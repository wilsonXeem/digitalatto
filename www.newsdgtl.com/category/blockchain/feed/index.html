<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-57976 size-medium" src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/8a5625c9-73fd-44b1-bf2a413ad89e2268.Original-scaled-e1653576938382-300x150.jpg" alt="Office buildings" width="300" height="150"  />The last few years have created a perfect storm of digitization and trust. Within the new Web3 partnership and ecosystem models coming to life now, powered by creator economy/token economy concepts, the full hope (promise) of the internet is on the horizon. Delivered in a digitally native experience (for or with a generation that won’t accept anything less), the future of enterprise blockchain has accelerated and evolved.</p>
<p>The blockchain market as we know it has matured to where we are seeing real adoption from enterprises, governments and financial institutions. Public chain technology has also become more resilient and scalable, and now with layer 2 solutions making them more useable, there is increasing experimentation and adoption in DeFi and for Web3 applications overall.</p>
<p>A hybrid enterprise blockchain solution can help organizations realize new business outcomes such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fine-grained security, privacy, auditable regulatory compliance and protection of competitive advantage</li>
<li>Agility to adapt to market changes and competitor moves</li>
<li>Single source of truth visible to all participating members in near real time with reduced friction, cost savings and efficiencies</li>
</ul>
<p>For the enterprise, unlocking the power of hybrid networks means thoughtful strategy, design and experience rooted in trusted data, tokenization, portability of assets and scalability of users. This digital convergence is the new table stakes for successful monetization in the digital economy and for de-risking an enterprise’s marginal dollar investment in the space. Today, we are delivering Web3 and metaverse consulting, leveraging years of market-leading client success powered by blockchain, working with both permissionless and private networks. We know that the potential has always been there for more. This week at Davos we’re delivering on that vision.</p>
<p>In one hybrid blockchain success story that we showcase this week, IBM Blockchain Services, together with our partner <a target="_blank" href="https://casperlabs.io/" rel="noopener">CasperLabs</a>, are trailblazing success together, leveraging hashed timelock contracts (HTLCs) to make organizations’ workflows and transactions more seamlessly interoperable between blockchain networks. This means a promise of future trust digitization, where in-enterprise blockchain solutions are precision engineered for the web3 world,</p>
<p><em>“We are excited to continue our partnership with CasperLabs, bringing to life real, measurable client outcomes powered by hybrid blockchain with speed, at scale. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/ipwe/" rel="noopener">IPwe</a> is the first of many new marketplace models in action for the industries re-imagined.”</em></p>
<p><em>— Anouk Brumfield, VP Blockchain Services, IBM </em></p>
<p>For clients of CasperLabs and IBM, this technology offers an exciting option, combining the enhanced security of a private consortium network running Hyperledger Fabric with the public verifiability and open market access enabled by Casper public blockchain capabilities. We’re very excited to see what we can create together!</p>

<p>Starting May 19, Qatari citizens and residents can open accounts with CoinMENA and link their bank accounts to it CoinMENA has become the first regional digital assets exchange to operate in Qatar.</p>



<p>Starting May 19, Qatari citizens and residents can open accounts with CoinMENA and access all the features within the platform, including linking their bank accounts to their CoinMENA wallets in order to enable streamlined deposits and withdrawals.</p>



<p>The Bahrain-headquartered firm recently became the first onshore licensed crypto exchange to introduce limit trading, enabling the platform’s users to set the price at which they wish to buy and sell crypto.</p>



<p>Users in Qatar will also be able to utilize the recently added features including withdrawing USDT via the TRON network for lower fees, and earning bonus rewards when they invite their friends through its referral program.</p>



<p>“We are delighted to become the first crypto exchange to offer our services in Qatar. Investors have been asking about our plans to enter the country for some time now, so this news represents a major milestone in our long-term geographic market expansion plans,” said CoinMENA co-founders Dina Saman and Talal Tabbaa. “Our team is constantly striving to onboard new countries and introduce new features to a wider audience.”</p>



<p>In January, the Central Bank of Bahrain issued the exchange, with a “Crypto Asset Services Company License – Category 2”. The Bahrain-headquartered digital asset exchange received the license after reportedly meeting all of the operational, technical, and security requirements outlined by the CBB. CoinMENA is a Sharia-compliant exchange, certified by the Shariyah Review Bureau. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>“I follow this Cryptohopper, and it allows me to periodically buy the top 10 coins in the market. That is the most risk-averse strategy you can have.”</em></span></p>
<p>During the early days when forums were still flooded with Bitcoin doubters Satoshi Nakamoto quoted: “If you don’t believe it or don’t get it, I don’t have the time to try to convince you, sorry.”  A lot has changed since 2008, the year in which Nakamoto published a white paper introducing the concepts behind bitcoin and blockchain. A whole industry has been created from that year onwards, also a company like <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cryptohopper.com/">Cryptohopper</a>, an AI-driven trading bot which hosts more than nine million transactions a month. The company, founded in 2017 by two Dutch brothers, Ruud Feltkamp and his brother Pim, quickly evolved to be a leader in the automated crypto trading industry, by allowing its users to automate trading strategies.</p>
<p>Ruud, well known in the Netherlands his acting career, from when he played in movies such as <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1411277?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk1">Lover or Loser</a> (2009),  <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0205190?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk3">Little Crumb</a> (1999) and a soap called, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096597?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk2">Good Times, Bad Times</a> (1990), took some valuable time out of his busy day to talk to Blockchain News about the future of his company, web 3 and about crypto regulation.</p>
<p><strong>BCN:</strong> “The Market capitalisation of the crypto industry grew threefold to $3 trillion in November of last year, but despite several factors driving growth, the market has also undergone turbulence, mainly from regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are often thought to operate out of the reach of national regulation, but in fact their valuations, transaction volumes and user bases react substantially to news about regulatory actions. Based on the recent significant capital inflow in the market, it appears cryptocurrencies might be growing immune to frequent regulatory crackdowns. Do you agree with this? What effect do you think regulation will have on the market capitalisation of crypto in the near and later future, of let’s say, 5 years’ time?”</p>
<p><strong>Ruud:</strong> “I think a lot of people who don’t know much about crypto look at it with a negative connotation. I think that is not correct. I think regulations are inevitable, and good for the sector. I mean all financial markets are regulated right? with a reason. I think it’s a good thing, only regulators should understand what entrepreneurs are facing, what challenges they have, and that is not always the case. I think in the Netherlands, in Europe, they are listening quite well, but the only big thing is obviously that every country has their own regulations that are kind of the same but also kind of different. In Europe you need licences in every country, but I think in general, regulations are good. That is one.</p>
<p>But your question, are cryptocurrencies growing immune to frequent regulatory crackdowns? No, I don’t think that cryptocurrencies are growing immune, but I think the fact that there now is a regulatory framework allows big parties to enter crypto as well. Previously in 2015 when you began with Blockchain News there were mainly consumers in crypto and primarily whales, people with a lot of money. And lately we have, say in the last two years, seen more institutional players stepping in. I think cryptocurrencies by itself are not immune to regulatory crackdowns, but I think thanks to regulation the sector is maturing and that’s why cryptocurrencies have been doing well.”</p>
<p><strong>BCN:</strong> “Should banks be moving towards digital currencies, or not?</p>
<p>This quote can be found on the website of the IMF:” If CBDCs are designed prudently, they can potentially offer more resilience, more safety, greater availability, and lower costs than private forms of digital money. That is clearly the case when compared to unbacked crypto assets that are inherently volatile. And even the better managed and regulated Stablecoins may not be quite a match against a stable and well‑designed central bank digital currency.</p>
<p>We know that the move towards CBDCs is gaining momentum, driven by the ingenuity of Central Banks.’</p>
<p>What do you think of this statement? Can CBCD’s be even considered cryptocurrencies anymore, with a bank in between?”</p>
<p><strong>Ruud:</strong> “It depends how you define crypto. If you define crypto to be absolutely decentralized, then no, but from a technical point of view, yes, it is crypto. It’s not that bad. In crypto we have this thing that we look at banks like they are evil, but that’s not the case. They are run by people, they make mistakes, but I think in general the idea of a Euro is good and is something I am quite enthusiastic about. If you compare it with, say something like another Stablecoin. What would you rather have, Tether, or something backed by the central bank, which is essentially the same, Tether or a crypto Euro.’’</p>
<p><strong>BCN:</strong> “Don’t you think that crypto itself, the whole blockchain idea, where you don’t need say insurance companies, banks etc. I mean, shouldn’t we be moving away from government run situations? Doesn’t the move towards CBDCs defeat that purpose?”</p>
<p><strong>Ruud:</strong> “I love DeFi, decentralized insurance for example. But people have a problem with inflation and banks and governments printing money, and it should be explained why they do that. But still people dislike governments doing that, hence they are going to an asset like bitcoin. But that still doesn’t mean a Euro is a bad thing. You go to a snack bar, and you say, can you please give me some fries with mayonnaise, that’s what we eat here in the Netherlands, then you want to know that will be one euro fifty, and you don’t want to hear, well today it’s this much, and you need to make a calculation every time. So, there is a certain convenience in printed money, keeping the price kind of stable, although it never completely stable. So, I think that is the good thing about euros, you exactly know what it means in terms of value.”</p>
<p><strong>BCN:</strong> “This is also what we are seeing in El Salvador, the volatility, this is what regular people don’t like about it.”</p>
<p><strong>Ruud:</strong> “But does that mean that people should keep their money in the bank in euros where it’s worth less, I don’t know, let’s say in between 5 to 12% every year? Well, everybody is now figuring out that keeping your money in the bank is a bad idea.”</p>
<p><strong>BCN:</strong> “Invest it in crypto……”</p>
<p><strong>Ruud:</strong> “Exactly. So, in that case CBDC are a good thing, Stablecoins should be worried, because now it is backed by somebody you can potentially trust more than anyone behind a Stablecoins, well, I say potentially, because there are lots of good parties in the space. But they should both have their place in crypto.”</p>
<p><strong>BCN:</strong> “How do you see the future of web 3?”</p>
<p><strong>Ruud:</strong> “In a nutshell what web 3 is all about is, where before you could play a game in 2D on the internet, now suddenly you can have various games in 3D on the internet, where you are the owner of the data, and potentially even use an in-game currency that has value outside of the game. You are the owner of your data, decentralized, so instead of having a social network like Facebook, you have a decentralized social network where you have ownership over the data you publish. For example, now, when you post a picture on Instagram, you are not the owner of that picture anymore, Instagram is. So, when you have the crypto Instagram you will have custodianship of the account, so if you forget your password, you will have a problem, because there is nobody who can help you. But also, if you post a picture, it’s yours and if you want to take it offline, you can do it, and nobody can block you basically. That is what web 3 is all about.”</p>
<p><strong>BCN:</strong> ‘’That’s quite nice, isn’t it?”</p>
<p><strong>Ruud:</strong>” I’m a big fan of what is coming, I get inspired a lot, there is so much stuff to talk about, but it’s not all great. It’s probably already there, you can easily make a decentralized messaging service, that is super easy, but that also means that criminals and terrorists can message each other without any intervenience of people, because it’s all heavily encrypted, and we cannot block them. They are the owners of their data so there is no control there. I am not saying web 3 is a bad thing, I love where we are going, but we also need to understand there are risks involved, and we need to understand as a community what kind of risk we expose ourselves to. That’s all. And how much we value our own privacy versus control and the risks.</p>
<p><strong>BCN:</strong> “And then finally, I wanted to ask you about Cryptohopper and the future of it, what’s is in the pipeline, any changes to the platform, partnerships?”</p>
<p><strong>Ruud:</strong> “There is a lot happening at the moment, but the problem is, the biggest part of it I cannot tell you yet, because it’s a little bit too premature, but there is big stuff coming up, and by the end of May I can hopefully tell you more about it.</p>
<p>What I can tell you now is that soon, well we haven’t even announced this product yet, so it’s a scoup, there is a product coming up, we call it the Copyhopper, and it is basically full hands-off copy trading, for the most novice traders to experience and use Cryptohopper. The hopper is obviously an automated trading platform, where all kinds of traders get automated trading, and this solution is for the real beginners amongst us. People who want to dip their toes into automated trading, that want something hands-off, something easy, something cheap. Currently it is in Beta, we don’t have an official launch date yet, but we will launch it soon.</p>
<p>People ask me a lot, “Hey Ruud, I don’t trade crypto, but I want to use Cryptohopper, what should I do?” My standard answer is, just start trading crypto first, and then see if automated trading is something for you. It’s kind of difficult and you need to know something about crypto. With the Copyhopper, you can fully copy somebody, but we also offer something called index-investing. So, you basically say, alright, I follow this crypto hopper, and it allows me to periodically buy the top 10 coins in the market. That is the most risk-averse strategy you can have. It’s the easiest way of investing, with the least risk involved. And that is also possible with the Copyhopper. It’s an entry product to Cryptohopper and ultimately, hopefully people can experience what else we have to offer, such as AI trading.”</p>
<p><strong>BCN:</strong> “Thank you for the interview. We will keep on following Cryptohopper, good luck with the platform.’’</p>
<p><strong>Ruud:</strong> “You’re welcome.”</p>

<p>LongHash Ventures, Asia’s first Web3 Accelerator and one of Asia’s leading Web3 venture funds, is continuing its partnership with Protocol Labs, creator of Filecoin and IPFS, to launch the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://longhash.vc/accelerator/filecoin-accelerator/"><u>3rd LongHashX Accelerator Filecoin Cohort</u></a>. The program aims to accelerate early-stage teams building projects in the Filecoin ecosystem.</p>
<p>Established in 2018, the LongHashX a Web3 investment fund and accelerator, has partnered with notable ecosystems such as Polkadot, Algorand, and Filecoin, among others. Past graduates from Filecoin Cohorts include Lit Protocol, a decentralized access control network; Huddle01, a decentralized secure video calling app; and Lighthouse, a permanent storage protocol.</p>
<p>“<i>We are very excited to continue our partnership with Protocol Labs as we launch the third LongHashX Accelerator Filecoin Cohort. As demand for decentralized storage grows, Filecoin is well-placed to be the leading choice for Web3 developers. We are looking forward to more NFT, GameFi, and Metaverse use cases, as well as middleware, infrastructure, and tooling protocols using Filecoin.

<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-57934 size-medium" src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/c456c076-a088-4f34-a737006cce2b3224.Original-300x135.jpg" alt="Transport truck on highway" width="300" height="135"  />There are moments that change the world, that create seismic shifts in what feels like an instant. The ongoing cycles of COVID pandemic and the fallout of the Russian war in Ukraine have changed the world. These shifts are felt daily in the world of trade, where we’re seeing new widespread adoption of digital solutions to overcome volatility; shortages and lockdown impacts fueling inflation; currency flux; and of course stress on global supply chains. As a result, both government and private organizations around the world are turning to crypto and enterprise ecosystem solutions, powered by blockchain.</p>
<h3 class="ibm-h3">Background: digitization of trade under COVID</h3>
<p>The onset of COVID increased the urgency of the digitization of trade, and the war in Ukraine ratcheted it up further still. We have learned that digitization alone is not going to prevent goods from being stuck in customs and on vessels for extended periods of time due to problems in processing paperwork. In many cases over the last years, goods could still not be offloaded because the paperwork workflow in those emerging digitized processes still needed to be reconciled between parties in a “manual” manner. While the paperwork had been digitally scanned, it still had to be “signed and stamped” to pass to the next stage of the workflow.</p>
<p>Trade through public ledgers and smart contracts can lower the costs of transacting by its optimum, as the reconciliation step across the trade ecosystem is automated. This capability and agility is critical now given the war in Ukraine. An <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://iccwbo.org/publication/global-survey-2018-securing-future-growth/">International Chambers of Commerce report</a> highlighted that with full digitization, global trade could increase by $9 trillion within 5 years, and that trade would grow by 46%. Such reductions in operational costs could drive positive GDP growth and provide small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) access to capital and thereby reduce the $1.5 trillion trade finance gap. This access to funding will be critical as part of the rebuilding work in eastern Europe after the war.</p>
<p>Business outcomes powered by blockchain are not limited to the enterprise. The effect of cryptocurrency acceleration in Russia and Ukraine is notable and reflects the differences between the two countries’ regulatory environments before the invasion.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, whose regulatory environment has sped up acceptance and promotion of digital currency adoption, the government has raised significant funds through NFTs and other cryptocurrency efforts.</p>
<p>In Russia, which lacked this regulatory promotion, there has been limited use of cryptocurrency to transfer funds in or out of the country. In fact, the dependency on the ruble is becoming severe, as international sanctions against Russia now limit the exchange of currencies.</p>
<p>The war shows five wartime advantages for countries that promote cryptocurrency through regulation — advantages that accrue to both a government and its citizens.</p>
<h3 class="ibm-h3">Cryptocurrency can improve access to capital during wartime</h3>
<p>The war in Ukraine caused a spike in cash withdrawals from banks as Ukrainians prepared for uncertain times. To prevent capital flight, the government of Ukraine recently banned its citizens from buying crypto with local currency.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the ruble collapsed, Russian citizens looked to cryptocurrencies as a store of value because they were not correlated, or indeed connected, to the local instability. These citizens can only make limited use of digital currencies for everyday purchases. But this wealth vehicle can provide citizens with a decentralized, censor-resistant safe harbor of their capital. During the conflict, crypto has become an increasingly popular method of transaction, as it is viewed as a secure alternative method to access finances.</p>
<h3 class="ibm-h3">Cryptocurrency can ease inflationary pressure</h3>
<p>In wartime situations where traditional currencies tend to fluctuate, the use of global cryptocurrencies could reduce volatility in price and currency supply. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has sent markets scrambling for alternative sources of oil, wheat, and sunflower outputs. To combat inflationary pressures, both consumers and SMEs can hedge against devaluing currencies by considering cryptocurrencies as value shelters.</p>
<h3 class="ibm-h3">Blockchain improves transparency and makes fundraising more public</h3>
<p>Ukraine, now a digital assets and cryptocurrency leader in Eastern Europe (with significant adoption even prior to the invasion), has raised significant funds over recent months by accepting donations through crypto exchanges to help finance its Department of Defense.</p>
<p>The Museum of War NFT helps supporters donate directly to the Ukrainian government without an intermediary organization, increasing donations by ensuring the transactions are public and secure. The data is recorded in a decentralized blockchain network, making the data difficult to tamper with. The system is available to everyone simultaneously, contributing to agility and transaction transparency.</p>
<h3 class="ibm-h3"><strong>Blockchain can help Ukraine rebuild by </strong><strong>improving access to capital</strong></h3>
<p>While traditional legacy banking systems require three days to complete a cross-border transaction, blockchain networks allow for transactions to be settled in several minutes. In late March, Ukrainian lawmakers requested that Ukraine be accepted into the European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) to support the reconstruction of Ukraine. Joining the international organization would achieve the goal of streamlining access to cross-border electronic services.</p>
<h3 class="ibm-h3">Looking to the future of digital trade</h3>
<p>Multinational companies should continue to expand their consideration of client outcomes powered by blockchain capabilities to not only capitalize on new market model capabilities, but also to foster the needed agility for uncertain times. What we’re seeing in 2022 is still just the beginning, as evaluation and acceptance grows for cryptocurrency and the blockchain.</p>

<p>Decentralized autonomous organization <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoadventure.com/cult-dao-review-building-towards-a-decentralized-future/"><u>CULT DAO</u></a>, is seeking to advance the decentralized finance revolution, announces Revolt (RVLT), which attracted the attention of Anonymous. The decentralized international activist and hacktivist group seems to support CULT DAO’s most recent concept, as it appears in the group’s recent Twitter bio and <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/YourAnonOne/likes"><u>likes</u></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot_2022-05-09_at_072714_1652070456Ino1Ex4wij-1024x588.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>This is not the first time Anonymous has hinted at their support for CULT DAO as on the 23rd March before a steep climb in CULT’s token price Anonymous posted the very same Charlie Chaplin The Great Dictator speech which makes up a core feature and soundtrack of CULT DAO’s website <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cultdao.io/"><u>https://cultdao.io</u></a><u>.</u></p>

<p>Revolt 2 Earn, the concept Anonymous appear to have shown support for, is the CULT DAO ecosystem’s first token. It was built on the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoadventure.com/the-beginner-guide-to-polygon-matic/"><u>Polygon blockchain</u></a> as a proof-of-stake (POS) token with 0.4% taxation and the DAO should issue it in the upcoming months. The token is CULT’s first sibling. However, while CULT works to fund the protocols accelerating decentralization, RVLT aims to support the individual CULT DAO users (The Many) working towards the same goal.</p>
<p>In a <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wearecultdao.medium.com/emancipate-the-many-from-wage-slavery-rvlt-b43e6431d51e"><u>recent blog</u></a>, Cult DAO founder Mr. O’Modulus talks about the Revolt 2 Earn concept:</p>
<p>“Society is designed to make it as difficult as possible to break away from economic, societal, and social norms. So what if supporting the $CULT ecosystem could be in itself a full-time or part-time job?”</p>
<p>This concept led him to develop a self-governing, autonomous ecosystem that would reward those who build and contribute on a large scale (The Guardians)  as well as those who do so at a smaller, individual yet just as important level. The latter revolutionaries are the Many, and they can use RVLT for both staking and rewards.</p>
<p>The Many are under direct government by the CULTmanders. These are RVLT stakers, and basically, every staker can be a CULTmander if they stake for a mid-long period.</p>
<p>Each month, the protocol will randomly pick 490 stakers and 10 consistent NFT owners from all the RVLT stakers (uRVLT owners). These 500 members have to approve or disprove the users’ action submissions supporting the “CULT revolution.” Their actions can include anything as simple as stickering, leafleting, shilling, or civil disobedience.</p>
<p>This system ensures both level and individual rewards and could allow users to break away from the current centralized system. In other words, it enables them to revolt by talking about CULT and the CULT Manifesto to others.</p>
<p>In  the same blog, Mr. O’Modulus says:</p>
<p>“This protocol exists to allow The Many do not have to rely on wage labor fully, or in part and to fill the gap and pay users to further the cause of decentralization and the CULT ecosystem.”</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.yuga.com/">Yuga Labs</a>, the collective behind the infamous Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible tokens, has been targeted by another cyber attack, or so called <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/26/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-hack-theft-art-simian-oblivion?ref=biztoc.com&amp;curator=biztoc.com&amp;utm_source=biztoc.com">phishing attack</a>. In a phishing attack, a criminal poses as someone else, in order to break in. The hackers gained access to the Instagram profile of the Bored Ape Yacht Club. In the attack, 133 NFTs were stolen, which together are estimated to be worth about 2.4 million dollars (more than 2.2 million euros).</p>
<p>Once in the account, the malicious hacker shared a fraudulent link to a fake Bored Ape Yacht Club website. People were promised free NFTs if they linked their wallets, but instead the hacker was able to take over their wallets.</p>
<p>In a tweet the bored Ape club said the following, “This morning, the official BAYC Instagram account was hacked. The hacker posted a fraudulent link to a copycat of the<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/"> BAYC website</a> with a fake Airdrop, where users were prompted to sign a ‘safeTransferFrom’ transaction. This transferred their assets to the scammer’s wallet.”</p>
<p>In the process, the hacker was able to seize control of four Bored Apes, as well as a host of other NFTs.</p>
<p>An NFT (non-fungible token) is a unique digital proof that shows that you own a certain piece of data that you can buy and sell, such as a digital artwork or the first Twitter message.</p>
<p>The stolen four ‘Bored Apes’ together have a value of about 1 million euros. The most expensive among them was Bored Ape 6623, which recently sold for 123 Ethereum, about 345,500 euros.</p>
<p>Bored Ape Yacht Club says it now has access to the Instagram account again. The malicious links have been removed. The NFT maker says it is investigating the situation and asks victims to contact them.</p>
<p>Yuga Labs and Instagram are now investigating how the hacker was able to gain access to the account. Apparently the two-factor authentication was enabled and the security practices surrounding the IG account were very tight.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Reports of banks applying for a crypto license have cropped up recently in jurisdictions with progressive regulatory regimes that allow for it. Last week, such an application was submitted by a bank in Portugal. Now, one of the largest banks in Germany wants to offer crypto custody and exchange services. Where traditional and large banks until very recently have seen cryptos as competition and shied away from it, we now start to see adoption even from some of the most conservative players in the banking field.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These moves can be interpreted as the beginnings of a race within the traditional banking field to gain a competitive edge by being the first entity in its local market to offer crypto services. From both a technological and a marketing perspective, crypto has already become the next big thing, so to speak.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Inevitably, this will only speed up the adoption of crypto as a mainstream financial service. However, it also shows that the demand for it is already so high across the whole spectrum of banking clients that it compels entities that were previously hostile to crypto to completely change course. You cannot resist change and crypto is the change unfolding in real time.”</p>
<p>Worldwide, more and more big banks have recently decided to invest in crypto, as there is an opportunity for serious gains. With cryptocurrencies dominating an ever expanding sector of the economy, there is lots of potential for big earnings. Cryptocurrencies have proven to be quite stable over the long term now, and it is becoming more clear that crypto and blockchain are not going to go away any time soon anymore. It is now becoming evident that big institutions aren’t going to shy away from the potential gains, despite the volatility risks.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">There has been a lot of talk <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-bitcoin-mozilla-will-only-accept-proof-of-stake-crypto-donations" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-bitcoin-mozilla-will-only-accept-proof-of-stake-crypto-donations&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1649944749555000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ujGvnxL8oUM9fDtxSsoT2">about Mozilla this week after the company decided to begin accepting PoS crypto again</a> after an outcry against Bitcoin forced it to suspend donations earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Mozilla Foundation had put cryptocurrency donations on hold in January following a community backlash sparked by trenchant criticism from co-founder Jamie Zawinski who openly said he wasn’t agreeing with the evironmental impact of crypto, he said: “Everyone involved in the project should be witheringly ashamed of this decision to partner with planet-incinerating Ponzi grifters”.</p>
<p>After this statement Mozilla announced it had paused crypto donations due to the online discussion around crypto’s environmental impact.</p>
<p>But Mozilla said it would continue to explore decentralized web technology but would only resume if would fit with its climate goals. It also said that in the spirit of open source, Mozilla would be transparent in the review process and share constant updates.</p>
<p>So now, the company behind the Firefox internet browser Mozilla announced it is accepting Proof-of-Stake (PoS) crypto donations again, in an attempt to appease its environmentally-conscious community. The company feels that its donations policies are now aligned with its climate commitment policy.</p>
<p><strong>So what exactly is the difference between PoW and PoS?</strong></p>
<p>Proof-of-Work (PoW) is the consensus mechanism that was first popularized for permissionless blockchains and cryptocurrencies through the Bitcoin network. The proof-of-work protocol is hugely energy-intense as it revolves around countless servers keeping the network alive, in return for a great deal of electricity and server capacity.</p>
<p>Proof-of-stake (PoS), on the other hand, reduces the amount of computational work needed to verify blocks and transactions that keep the blockchain, and thus a cryptocurrency, secure. It can be no more than a computer set-up to become a validator and verificator. It sends and receives a lot of data but does not require the calculating power needed as in a PoW consensus mechanism.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Critisism </strong></span></p>
<p>While there has been a lot of critisism on the crypto donations and the environmental impact they have on our planet, there is also critisism on the entire Mozilla backlash itself, saying it’s not only about how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are generated and sustained, but just as much about how the energy that is used is consumed.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-feiler-b7529b4/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-feiler-b7529b4/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1649944749555000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Y0Rc1_txnOzMzJwQlbYYJ">Hugo Feiler</a>, CEO and co-founder at <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.minima.global/about" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.minima.global/about&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1649944749555000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1jZ8WQP5qXKh2-ZbAYJNN5">Minima</a>, says:</p>
<p>“The amount of energy consumed by a blockchain’s consensus mechanism should not determine whether it is sustainable or not. The only thing that matters is how the energy used is consumed.</p>
<p>Enabling anyone to cooperate to build and secure the network, energy consumption is decentralized across many devices. This facilitates environmental sustainability by enabling everyone to source a small amount of energy in a climate-neutral way, which is much easier than doing so than for centralized energy production seen on other PoW blockchains.</p>
<p>Minima utilises an implementation of PoW known as Tx-PoW that allows each network participant to do a small amount of PoW by running a complete node on the network.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, we believe that complete decentralization and cooperation is the only way of achieving optimal sustainability, so that is what we have created with Minima.”</p>
