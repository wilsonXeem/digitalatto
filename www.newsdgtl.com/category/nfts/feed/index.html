<div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
<p>Last week, the NFT Plazas team hit up Genesis, the first-ever gamified crypto event to take place in the Web3-rich city of London. Organised by <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nickel_factory">Nickel Factory</a>, a unique startup on a mission to bring decentralised communities closer together through immersive and interactive IRL events, the evening was jam packed with amazing talks, a gamified prize hunt, and various other performances that were a pleasure to witness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h4><strong>Interviews &amp; Alpha</strong></h4>
<p>As with our venture to the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nftplazas.com/nft-plazas-nfc-summit-lisbon/">NFC Summit</a> in Lisbon, Genesis was full to the brim with enthusiasm from all corners of Web3, meaning as official media partners, we were able to take advantage of an eclectic mix of event partners and attendees by getting up, close and personal through in-person interviews.</p>
<p>In doing so, we were able to retrieve <strong>alpha insight</strong> into many of the projects attending the event, including the likes of upcoming free-to-play NFT game ‘OpiPets,’ Web3 educators ‘Blockchain Sensei,’ NFT documentarists ‘Metacitzn,’ and more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h4><strong>Incredible Ambience &amp; Performances</strong></h4>
<p>Away from the interviews, we were able marvel at the holographic and 3D tech on show from tech company Unifyvsn, browse the array of <strong>NFT artwork dotted around the venue</strong>, and watch attendees immerse themselves in the QR-oriented gamified showdown.</p>
<p>In addition, visual effects specialists Escape Studios screened their multi-awarding winning picture ‘Shimmer,’ and Moses Concas, a winner of Italy’s Got Talent, was able to provide a (literal) breathtaking harmonica beatboxing performance, which was then followed by an interview with NFT Plazas as part of his music-come-street art NFT project ‘Imagine Action’.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When taking time away from the explicit ongoings of the event, the canal-side terrace of <strong>Studio 94</strong> (the event’s venue which was aptly situated in the vibrant, cosmopolitan area of Hackney Wick) provided an ideal space for interacting with the ever-interesting Web3 community of London. Here, drinks were flowing, music was blasting, and most importantly, networks were forming.</p>
</p>
<h4><strong>More From the NFT Plazas Team</strong></h4>
<p>As NFT Plazas continues to deliver the latest and greatest NFT news to our audience, daily and for free that is, we will certainly be attending more of these awesome IRL events. We would also like to say a big thank you to Nickel Factory for hosting the event, and allowing us to get our media kits all over it.</p>
<p>With this in mind, stay tuned to our <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYKElPbw0D1a6GE1McBH2iQ">YouTube channel</a> to ensure you don’t miss any of the <strong>interviews</strong> we conducted at Genesis London, and whilst you’re there, check out our array of fascinating interviews from NFC Lisbon.</p>

<p>We’ve all been waiting for this question. How can one get wealthy via the use of NFTs? Please remember that NFTically is not a financial counsellor and that investing in non-traditional securities is very hazardous. Make this decision at your peril.</p>
<p>There are a few things you should think about before attempting to get wealthy with NFTs and their related technologies.</p>
<p></p>
<div><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://market.nftically.com/login?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=blogads"><img src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nftically-ads-1.jpeg" style="width:100%;"/></a></div>
<p></p>
<h2>Things to think about before investing in NFTs</h2>
<p>What are your objectives? How much money do you need to consider yourself wealthy, and how much time do you give to attain this goal? Is there anything else you can do before attempting to become rich to obtain the same degree of satisfaction that you believe being wealthy would provide?</p>
<p>I’m talking about simple things like paying off your bills and cutting down on your expenditures. I know you don’t want to hear this, but it’s something you should think about before attempting to get wealthy via NFTs.</p>
<p>Because of their poor spending habits, someone earning $300,000 per year may have the same life as someone earning $30,000 per year.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the inverse is true. Someone earning $30,000 per year may live more peacefully and stress-free than someone earning $300,000 per year simply because they have no costs and do not squander money on items they do not need.</p>
<p>My argument is that if you can’t manage $30,000 effectively, how can you expect to handle $300,000, much alone $3 million? You will not.</p>
<p>After you’ve asked yourself these critical and realistic questions and resolved them, you can start thinking about a strategy to develop wealth using NFTs.</p>
<p>When selecting how to earn much money with NFTs, you must be entirely honest with yourself and everyone else your actions may impact.</p>
<h2>Is your only objective with NFTs to earn much money? </h2>
<p>Or, do you want to start your own company using NFTs and create a flourishing and rewarding profession for yourself?</p>
<p>Before getting wealthy with NFTs, it is critical to realize that there is much more to it than the NFT itself.</p>
<p>You need to address various challenges and solutions first and then begin working toward your goals daily, acknowledging that it will take a significant amount of time and patience to achieve something that many people will likely never succeed in their entire lifetimes.</p>
<p>Being realistic about your objectives and taking little measures every day to attain them will set you apart from someone who wishes they were wealthy but does not plan and execute to make it happen.</p>
<p>It isn’t easy to get wealthy. Getting money with NFTs may be much more difficult. Especially if you don’t comprehend the potential of NFTs, their capabilities, and the reality that the human(s) behind the technology, not the fact that it’s an “NFT,” is what gives an NFT worth.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve got that out of the way, let’s speak about how you can become wealthy utilizing NFTs as your vehicle.</p>
<h2>How to get rich using NFTs</h2>
<p>This is the question we’ve all been waiting for. How can you make money using NFTs? Please remember that I am not a financial counselor and that investing in NFTs is very dangerous. You do so entirely at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Here are several methods to make money using NFTs:</strong></p>
<h3>1. Buy and sell NFTs</h3>
<p>Purchasing NFTs with the potential to appreciate is one of the simplest methods to earn much money with NFTs. It’s straightforward. You buy an NFT for $5 and subsequently sell it for $50.</p>
<p>Although day trading is one of the most common methods for individuals to make money with NFTs, it is also one of the riskiest ways to invest in NFTs.</p>
<p>In general, day traders are only interested in purchasing NFTs at a low price (usually shortly after they become available) and then selling them for a profit of double, treble, or even more, with no regard for the NFT project’s long-term profitability (brand).</p>
<p>Remember that day trading is a full-time job. It makes no difference whether you trade equities or NFTS; you must keep a close eye on the market. You’ll know when it’s best to purchase and when it’s best to sell.</p>
<p>If you want to day-trade NFTs, make sure you have a certain amount of money set out for trading. In this manner, you won’t blow your whole bank account on something that may backfire. </p>
<h3>2. Investing in startup brands.</h3>
<p>You may invest in NFTs in the same way that you invest in equities over time or become a venture capitalist (providing funding to young enterprises). Investing in an NFT with a long-term perspective, on the other hand, might be much more challenging than day trading.</p>
<p>If you want to invest in NFTs with the long-term objective of accumulating money, you must do A LOT MORE research on the creator and what they are seeking to develop. You wouldn’t hand over a large sum of money to a random individual who claims to be able to make you wealthy, would you?</p>
<p>This is precisely what many folks in the NFT area are doing. It’s borderline gambling, in my opinion. Investing in a person without knowing anything about them is the fastest way to lose your money and your faith and hope in technology as a whole.</p>
<p>If you want to assist someone raises finance while still making a profit, you need to do your homework. Investing long-term in individuals who are developing something extraordinary is my favorite approach to support NFTs since I like builders.</p>
<p>There are a few fundamentals you should learn. Who is the NFT’s creator? Examine the individual’s job history. Were their previous efforts a success or a failure? These factors may reveal a great deal about how well your NFT investment will perform in the long term.</p>
<p>I wrote a blog post titled The NFT Boom | What Investors Need To Know. This article covers some of the most important factors I consider before purchasing a possibly good NFT. By good, I mean an NFT that will grow in value over time.</p>
<p>Finally, investing in an NFT with the goal of long-term prosperity requires extensive study, patience, and intuition. Remember that when you invest in an NFT, you invest in the NFT’s creator(s).</p>
<h3>3. Create your own Non-Fungible Token</h3>
<p>Of usual, the finest was reserved for last. Suppose you are a creative builder or someone enthusiastic about a specific issue. In that case, you may use NFTs as a platform to create something extraordinary and even earn a living doing so.</p>
<p>NFTs, you see, is just a technology platform that enables artists and businesses to design and market products. Anything could be turned into an NFT. Whether you are a painter, sculptor, fitness coach, or yoga teacher, you can utilize NFTs to provide excellent value to your customers, build trust, and be entirely upfront about your offers.</p>
<p>It is up to you, as the developer, to decide how and what you will give. Creating NFTs is, in my opinion, the most challenging method to get wealthy with NFTs, but it may also be the most gratifying.</p>
<p>If you reach the point where you’re earning much money selling NFTs, it’s probably because you put in a lot of time and effort to create a strong reputation with your customers and other individuals in your area.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you are developing and selling your own NFTs to generate money, you have chosen this as your vocation, and with it comes a lifetime of enjoyment and, of course, riches if you do it well.</p>
<p>As a result, I feel this option is the most rewarding and the most difficult.  If you believe that starting your own company and integrating NFTs is appropriate, you should read our blog “<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nftically.com/blog/what-are-the-best-nfts-to-invest-in-2022/">What are the best NFTs to invest in 2022?</a>” to invest immediately.</p>
<h4>Tips for Using NFTs to Become Rich</h4>
<p>Overall, we can employ several strategies and words of wisdom while generating money with NFTs that have remained true when it comes to wealth development in general. Let’s take a look at a few of these suggestions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before acquiring additional money, consider strategies to cut your present expenditure.</li>
<li>Pay off any outstanding debts.</li>
<li>Invest time in learning about personal money.</li>
<li>Don’t allow your emotions to get in the way of the truth.</li>
<li>Concentrate on investing in people and brands that you care about.</li>
<li>Make things you like to earn, not those that will make you the most money.</li>
<li>Make a budget</li>
<li>Don’t spend money you can’t afford to lose; instead, establish a certain amount of money you’re ready to risk to make more money.</li>
<li>Diversify your investing portfolio.</li>
<li>Always seek to learn more while being modest.</li>
<li>Assist those who are on a similar path as you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these suggestions may seem to be wide, I can assure you that they are incredibly beneficial and will eventually help you develop and retain your money.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>If there’s one thing I hope you’ve learned from reading this blog, there are many factors to consider before even thinking of being rich using NFTs.</p>
<p>Be truthful to yourself, others, and your objectives and expectations.</p>
<p>Although there are several methods to earn much money with NFTs—buying, selling, and building your own—all come with a high level of risk and a thorough grasp of the current market at your transactions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, how individuals generate money today with NFTs will only expand as technology advances and the various use-cases of NFT technology</p>

<p>Sprightly 81-year-old all-time rocker, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ringostarrmusic">Ringo Starr</a>, will take his multitude of talents into the metaverse, launching an <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nftplazas.com/learn-about-nfts/">NFT</a> collection and virtual gallery as he puts his faith in the technological world of Web3.</p>
<p>The former second best drummer in the Beatles’ first-ever NFTs will debut on <strong>June 12</strong> via <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JuliensAuctions">Julien’s auction house</a>. Arriving in the shape of five audio visual pieces titled ‘The Creative Mind of a Beatle’, each NFT will feature artwork and drum compositions created by the rocker and partnered with a signed print of the original item.</p>
<p>All in all, 20 NFTs will hit the market, made up of five designs of four editions each, with an unsurprisingly psychedelic explosion of colour offering a glimpse into the mind of one of the most prominent musicians in rock history. Each item will debut with an<strong> opening bid of $1,000</strong>, as he hopes to attract the interest of his army of fans. Ringo’s portion of proceeds will benefit the charitable exploits of the Lotus Foundation.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Backing up Ringo’s metaverse adventures, the ‘Starr’ will also launch his own gallery within the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/spatialxr">Spatial</a> framework, providing fans with the ability to peruse his creations within a magnificent digital environment. Inside which, owners of the aforementioned Ringo NFTs will also unlock a <strong>virtual meet and greet</strong> with the rock legend himself.</p>

<div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
<p>On the face of it, NFTs promise unchangeable and undisputable ownership of the contents contained within a smart contract. So, what happens then, when an asset sets sail through the perilous waters of grand larceny and subterfuge. This is the conundrum currently facing televisual producer, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/SethGreen">Seth Green</a>, a scenario which will likely set a legal precedent for the industry.</p>
<p>Over the last six months or so, Seth has wiled away his days on the ambitious ‘White Horse Tavern’ project, an intriguing live-action televisual concept where NFTs share and interact with the world we live in, with Seth being the proud owner of all the assets contained within the production. Earlier in May however, the star of the show, a Bored Ape by the name of ‘<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/8398">Fred Simian</a>’ was swiped in a <strong>dastardly phishing heist</strong>, along with fellow NFTs, two Mutant Apes and a Doodle.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">.<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/SethGreen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SethGreen</a> new trailer for his new show, keep your eyes peeled<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/BoredApeYC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BoredApeYC</a> <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GutterCatGang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GutterCatGang</a> <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/veefriends?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@veefriends</a> <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://t.co/ZzYN87HYWA">pic.twitter.com/ZzYN87HYWA</a></p>
<p>— FFVV1211.eth (@FFVV1211) <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/FFVV1211/status/1528043201885442048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2022</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The yellow-bellied attack occurred just as Seth put the final touches to the show’s first trailer. Following the theft however, the devious phisherman quickly sold the asset to crypto recluse DarkWing84, who then quite sensibly and immediately transferred it to a vault. All the while, Seth’s desperate pleas reverberate throughout the Twitter community.</p>
<p>Going forward, <strong>Seth Green will attempt an amicable solution</strong>, only following a legal course if absolutely necessary. According to his legal team however, the IP rights remain with the star due to the nature of the acquisition.</p>
<p>Delving deeper, Seth Green apparently obtained his beloved Ape from none other than <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/steveaoki">Steve Aoki</a>. A man known industrywide for his uncanny ability to plant a hex on any NFT he touches. Keep eyes on this case, it will likely define the future of the NFT legal situation.</p>

<p>Multiple winner of ARIA Awards, indie rock band <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/boyandbear">Boy &amp; Bear</a> is propelling itself into Web3 through the launch of an NFT collection in collaboration with American Express. As its name, ‘Boy &amp; Bear x Back The Night’ suggests, the collection coincides with the credit card brand’s ‘Back The Night’ music festival later this month.</p>
<p>The NFTs feature Back The Night digital artwork which resembles artwork from the band’s latest single ‘State of Flight’. There are three tiers of NFTs in the collection, with 200 Blue versions for $15 a piece, four Gold versions for $200 a piece, and a 1/1 Platinum version which is on auction until 10PM BST on May 26th.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In addition to their artistic aesthetic, the NFTs also serve as an access key for extra <strong>Boy &amp; Bear experiences and merchandise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></strong></p>
<p>In an effort to ensure as much positivity is rendered from the launch as possible, the band has opted for the NFTs to be minted on the carbon-neutral <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fanaply.com/">Fanaply</a> NFT marketplace, 70% of the sale’s revenue will be pumped back into the music industry through donations to the Support Act charity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In making a statement on their<strong> inaugural NFT launch</strong>, the Aussie band had this to say: “<em>We’ve experienced how badly the Aussie music industry has been hit over the last couple of years and having the opportunity to create our own NFTs and provide some awesome experiences with American Express for our fans, all in a way that tangibly gives back to Support Act – feels great. It’s nice to be able to play a small part in something bigger</em>”.</p>
<p>For those in Oceania wishing to experience Boy &amp; Bear in its full, IRL capacity, you can catch them at their ‘Back The Night’ music festival performance, which takes place at Surly’s American Tavern, Sydney, at 5PM (local time) on May 29th, 2022.</p>

<p>Does the thought of creating the perfect Metaverse dwelling fill you with dread? The idea of being judged on you own artistic merit leave you breaking into cold sweats? Then fear no longer, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cryptovoxels">Voxels</a> has arrived with a magnificent solution in Architecture Island. Pre-built dwellings of unparalleled opulence are available for those without the time or ability to go at it alone.</p>
<p>Just like in the physical world, some folks will go to great lengths to design and build their perfect residence. Others however, would rather move right in to a <strong>fabulous edifice</strong> lovingly prepared by someone who knows what they’re doing. So, to cater for the latter, Voxels has built Architecture Island – fully customizable metaverse dwellings for the artistically inept.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Presenting Architect Island: the FIRST Voxels island with turn-key parcels!</p>
<p>A collaboration between Voxels and metaverse architect/builders will be available starting today.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In this grand new addition to the Voxels realm, vast edifices dominate the skyline in a myriad of colours, shapes and styles, all coming together in an eclectic array of <strong>finely designed properties</strong>. Each property is as unique in its appearance as it is grand in its demeanour.</p>
<p>To ensure the best quality workmanship, Voxels has recruited some of the best OG designers in the industry, each bringing their own specific brand of style into the voxelated universe. So, take a wander through the cherry blossom on the way to that traditional style Japanese palace. Or, hole up in an ultra-modern high-rise apartment. The choice is entirely up to you.</p>

<p>Bulls and Apes Project (B.A.P) chronicles the evolutionary tale of a human-made species of Bull, as it embraces its innate curiosity to eventually stumble upon the culture of its creators – the humans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Although invigorated and engaged within abundance of lore, the project’s storyline is currently open-ended, as it appears the human creator is on the cusp of introducing mayhem to the somewhat stagnant and content society, through the use of an army of Apes. This may sound cruel to begin with, but such action is not only for the benefit of the Bulls, as without conflict and rivalry, societal progression cannot be made.</p>
<h4><b>Lore</b></h4>
<p>The 10,000 unique Bulls are created by a visionary human being who decided to build his own society from scratch, after already offering their wisdom to the many civilizations and distant planets which resided in the universe.</p>
<p>With a fusion of human and Bull genetics, the Bulls are rendered bipedal walkers which host an <strong>array of different genetics</strong> (traits) which distinguish themselves from ‘original’ Bulls. They all also originated at the depth of the Mountain of Creation, which was formed from the powers of the creator.</p>
<p>As part of their creator’s plan, each Bull possesses one of four birthmarks at the bottom of their feet, with each representing a respective Guild. Each Guild exited the Mountain of Creation in its own direction, ultimately leading to each building separate, but blossoming societies.</p>
<p>As each society progressed, questions around their reproductive capacities and evolutionary path began to surface, which ultimately led to the Bulls discovering the cultures of their <strong>creators and genetic cousins</strong> – the humans. Here, Bulls began adopting the norms of humans, with half of the population harmoniously deciding to keep to their traditional roots. To the creator’s surprise, and unlike the human race, such division caused zero conflicts, and further, prompted a period of peace which inadvertently halted progress.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For now, the lore behind B.A.P ends at the point where the creator is drafting up plans to unleash Apes into the Bull societies, to further encourage the Bulls to manifest the traits in which the creator initially fell in love with, such as loyalty, power, and aggression.</p>
</p>
<h4><b>Project Utility<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></h4>
<p>Holding a B.A.P NFT comes with an array of utility avenues, beginning with the artistic aesthetic of the Bulls themselves. Each OG Bull is a unique, 3D generative rendering which sports an array of different traits and rarities, to ensure there is a style for everyone.</p>
<p>Through holding a B.A.P NFT, you earn Methane ($METH) tokens each day, with the rate of OG Bull NFTs being 10 METH per day, which can then be used for new NFT mints, access to IRL events, or for any other B.A.P metaverse purchases.</p>
<p>There is also the<strong> Inner Circle</strong>, with informational content from within the Web3 industry, and being part of the B.A.P community through attending IRL events, conferences, parties, partnerships, physical and mental health wellness initiatives, mentorship programs, and charity events.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The project aims to have a meaningful and lasting impact on the lives of community members. Using the experience, knowledge, and connections the founders have accumulated over their careers, they intend to bring access to education, mentorship, and opportunity that many would never otherwise see.</p>
<p>With B.A.P also being a fully funded project pre-mint, revenue generation isn’t a primary concern for the project, meaning <strong>mint funds can be locked away</strong> with the ability to be recollected through a flexible refund policy dubbed the Money-Back Guarantee (which is active from 31 days post mint until 180 days post mint).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The first mint will be of 10,000 total OG Bulls on <strong>May 31 at 5PM EST,</strong> with future mints including a 9,000 Teen Bull collection and a 500 God Bull collection.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-39240 size-full" src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bullsandapes.jpg" alt="bulls and apes nft" width="666" height="854"  /></p>
<h4><b>Team<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></h4>
<p>The B.A.P team is fully doxxed and loaded with experience. CEO Anthony Mongiello is an Operations and Technology Leader with almost 20 years of experience in tech-related business development and road mapping. The project’s two other co-founders Manny Coats and Guillermo Puyol both have a wealth of experience in working on mobile games, software development and marketing, which ultimately led their previous project now being part of a <strong>$1.5 billion enterprise.</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To get a better understanding of the masterminds before the projects, listen to their appearances on various podcasts (such as Crypto Business, Entrepreneurs on Fire, The Nifty Show, My NFT Journey, NFT 365, and The Mojo NFT Show), or alternatively, visit the project’s <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYgJ24d9GJPJTtkZ8_ROPcA/featured">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<h4><b>Roadmap</b></h4>
<p>In wake of the upcoming 100% pre-funded mint of OG Bulls, God Bulls, Super-Rare God Bulls, Stylin’ Teen Bulls, Apes, and other collections will all be dropped along with a physical card game concept which’ll tie them all together.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Further down the line, a B.A.P metaverse will be developed, along with potential gaming partnerships and official merchandise in the realms of fashion and toys.</p>

<div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
<p>To pay homage to perhaps the greatest point guard of all time, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nbatopshot">NBA Top Shot</a> is releasing an NFT collection based on Earvin ‘Magic’ Johnson. In doing so, the most pivotal and historic plays of the 5 x NBA champion, 3x Finals MVP, 3x NBA MVP, and 12x NBA All-Star will be etched onto the blockchain forever.</p>
<p>The collection, which is dubbed ‘’The Anthology: Magic Johnson,’ is set for <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nbatopshot.com/listings/pack/anthology-magic-pack">launch</a> on the NBA Top Shot platform on June 7th, where <strong>1,600 NFT packs</strong> will be available to be picked up for $399 each. Within each pack will be 1 Moment NFT from either the Rare or Legendary tiers, with Rare tier NFTs depicting Johnson’s ‘Platter Pass’ and ‘Game Winner vs. Celtics’ (during the 1987-88 season), whilst the Legendary tier NFTs depict his ‘Rookie Start at Center in the Finals’ in the 1979-80 season, as well as his ‘Around the Body Pass’ in 1984-85.</p>
<p>Despite an abundance of packs seemingly being up for grabs, a whopping 1,200 of the packs will be airdropped to users with a <strong>Top Shot score</strong> of at least 150,000 (i.e. putting them in a ‘priority queue’), meaning there will only be 400 freely available packs available in the ‘general queue’ (which do not require a NBA Top Shot score to be purchased).</p>
<p>In taking to <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/1528737519663194112">Twitter</a> to relay his excitement for the drop, Johnson had this to say: “<i>I’m really excited to partner with @nbatopshot to release my first NFTs and bring some of my favorite Moments from my career to fans everywhere. Fans get to see just a few of my favorite plays from my career!”</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>After announcing its plans to launch a $100 million-backed NFT marketplace back in February, nostalgic gaming retailer-come-Web3 explorer <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GameStop">GameStop</a> has launched a beta version of its crypto and NFT wallet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The GameStop Ethereum-based crypto and NFT wallet allows users to store, send, and receive crypto and NFTs through (and without leaving) their web browsers, whilst also allowing them to <strong>interact with Web3 apps</strong> when browsing. The wallet is also non-custodial, meaning users can access their assets via a private key/secret recovery phrase, and integrate it with an array of hardware wallets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For now, the beta wallet is only available as an extension for Google Chrome and Brave web browsers, however, according the company’s site, it’ll soon be available for mass adoption through being launched as an iOS iPhone app.</p>
<p>As many will already know, the wallet comes in preparation of <strong>GameStop’s launch of an NFT marketplace</strong>, which, according the company’s fourth-quarter earnings report in March, will be live by the end of July. Upon its launch, the wallet will be seamlessly integrated onto the marketplace, where in addition, users will be able to enjoy deflated Ethereum gas fees thanks to the platform’s integration of Layer 2 protocol Immutable X.</p>
