<p>When speaking of Web3 coins, some may automatically think of cryptocurrency tokens such as Bitcoin and Ethereum – but it’s much more than that. In fact, Web3 coins form part of a much larger ecosystem which many believe is the future of both the internet and finance as we know it. Expanding further than just being an online currency, digital coins also give investors the power to vote on issues concerning the relevant protocols.</p>
<h3>Starting With the Basics</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a> (also known as Web3.0) is the next generation of the internet, an ecosystem that is decentralized in nature, integrating the power of blockchains, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), cryptocurrency and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Although these concepts have been floating around the web for quite some time – some still find it difficult to fully understand what all of them mean. <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">Blockchains</a> are online ledgers that store information across a number of locations on a network, which makes hacking and data leaks a thing of the past. <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/17/business/what-is-nft-meaning-fe-series/index.html">NFTs</a> are one-of-a-kind, digital assets, which live on a blockchain, can be purchased and sold freely, or be held as an investment. <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cointelegraph.com/decentralized-automated-organizations-daos-guide-for-beginners/what-is-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work">DAOs</a> are the next generation of organizations, which function on rules that are encoded on blockchains, ensuring full transparency and decentralized, democratic governing bodies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What brings the Web3 ecosystem to life is Web3 coins, which will allow for all transactions to take place, through the use of crypto wallets. On top of this, many coins give investors voting power when it comes to important decisions and changes regarding the protocol. Seeing as so many different Web3 coins exist, some may find it confusing to decide which one/s to invest in. Whether a beginner or expert in the crypto universe, a vast number of Web3 coins exist which facilitate different uses across a number of industries, all focusing on different functions. Coins such as GAL, HNT and FIL are certainly the top Web3 coins to look out for in 2022, as they are making strides in bringing Web3 to life.</p>
<h4>1, Project Galaxy (GAL)</h4>
<p>Having launched at the beginning of 2022, the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://galaxy.eco/">Project Galaxy</a> ecosystem aims to provide users with an open, collaborative credential network. Being the largest Web3 credential data network in the world, Project Galaxy helps developers and DAOs to leverage NFTs and digital credential data. This is done through curators utilizing their native <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/project-galaxy/">GAL</a> token and signaling a credential data set’s value, which is then incentivized through the split of revenue amongst credential stakeholders. The main goal of the Project Galaxy team is to build better products and communities via the credential data network they’ve built.</p>
<h4>2. Helium (HNT)</h4>
<p><strong> </strong>Often being labeled as “The People’s Network”, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.helium.com/">Helium</a> allows for low-power devices to communicate with one another and transmit data over a network of nodes, called hotspots. This decentralized network focuses on powering  IoT devices, which are physical devices with the capability of connecting to the internet, such as light bulbs and thermostats. Think smart home devices – which you control from your phone. Through the Helium network, users know that their data is less likely to get hacked. The native token used on this network is <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/helium/">HNT</a>, which is used for all data and transactions.</p>
<h4>3. Filecoin (FIL)</h4>
<p>Time and again, global corporations have failed their users through poor data protection, leading to private data being hacked, spread and misused without their consent. <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a> is here to save the day, offering a decentralized storage solution that allows users to rent unused hard drive space through blockchain mechanisms. The native currency coin, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/filecoin/">FIL</a>, is used to record and make transactions on the platform. Made by <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> and being built on top of <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ipfs.io/">InterPlanetary File System</a>, this blockchain technology ensures top of the range, secure storage solutions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Whether a newbie or a fanatic of the crypto universe, Web3 does not limit itself to one interest or industry. Through Web3 coins, not only can users explore the future of the internet, but also ensure full protection of their data, while investing in the different ecosystems that are on offer. There is certainly no better time to get involved and invest than the present.</p>

<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has remained at a high value recently, a sign that could be bearish for the crypto’s price.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio On Verge Of Entering “Very High Risk” Zone</h2>
<p>As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/628e3e5078e9260215d55358">post</a>, the 72-hour MA whale ratio is near 0.90, the very high risk zone.</p>
<p>The “<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/correction-soon-bitcoin-whale-ratio-elevated/">exchange whale ratio</a>” is an indicator that’s defined as the sum of top ten inflows to exchanges divided by the total inflows.</p>
<p>In simpler terms, this metric tells us what part of the total inflows are contributed by the ten largest transactions, which typically belong to the whales.</p>
<p>When the value of this indicator is above 0.85, it means whales occupy a very large percentage of exchange inflows right now.</p>
<p>As investors usually transfer their Bitcoin to exchanges for selling purposes, such a trend can be a sign that whales are <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bearish-signal-whales-ramp-up-dumping/">dumping</a> at the moment.</p>
<p>The indicator’s value usually remains above this threshold during BTC bear markets, or fake bull for mass dumping.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Related Reading | <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-trading-volume-plummets-down-recent-top/">Bitcoin Trading Volume Plummets Down From Recent Top</a></em></strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, values below the 0.85 mark usually signify that whale inflows are currently in a healthier balance with the rest of the market. The ratio’s value usually remains in this region during bull runs.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio (72-hour MA) over the past couple of months:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/gIRR68lD_3008d1ed286dddf24188fff6495b59159efc19eb55116a08432da9d04fc202b7.png" alt="Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio " width="1280" height="666"/></p>
<pre style="text-align: center">It looks like the indicator has been at a high value recently | Source: <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/628e3e5078e9260215d55358">CryptoQuant</a></pre>
<p>As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has a value of about 0.89 right now, above the 0.85 threshold.</p>
<p>According to the quant in the post, values above 0.90 may be considered the “very high risk” zone. So, the current value of the indicator is very close to that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Related Reading | <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/investors-may-expect-downside-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-market-for-the-next-3-months/">Investors May Expect Downside For Bitcoin And Ethereum Market For The Next 3 Months</a></em></strong></p>
<p>In this month so far, the ratio’s value has almost always remained above the 0.85 line, with a couple of spikes above the 0.90 level.</p>
<p>The analyst believes whales are active right now due to the FED May Meeting Minutes, and if the ratio remains high in the near future, then it could spell trouble for Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-range-30k/">Bitcoin’s price</a> floats around $28.8k, down 2% in the last seven days. Over the past thirty days, the crypto has lost 30% in value.</p>
<p>The below chart shows the trend in the price of the coin over the last five days.</p>

<p>BTC mining has evolved from CPU to GPU and finally to ASIC, setting off a hardware “arms race”. Since more advanced mining chips are introduced, the hashrate of mining rigs has been on the rise, making mining extremely difficult. Meanwhile, hashrates are centralized by big mining farms and large institutions, and retail miners now struggle to gain the right of block updating solely relying on their own hashrates. To stay in the game, more and more miners choose to join a mining pool for stable mining revenue.</p>
<p>Before choosing one from many mining pools out there, miners should think about the following factors. First, brand recognition. In general, famous pools are more reliable because they are often highly recognized by the miner community. Second, user experience in both the products and the services the pool provided. A pool with a full range of products, in most cases, enables efficient and convenient mining experiences. All in all, brand recognition, and user experience in products and services are all backed by the tech capacity of the team behind the pool. Strong tech capacity allows a pool to offer a sound mining environment, so as to better safeguard the interests of miners.</p>
<h3>6 years of solid steps: ViaBTC is reliable and trustworthy</h3>
<p>In March 2016, Haipo Yang, the founder of ViaBTC, developed and deployed ViaBTC Pool on his own. Only two months later, ViaBTC Pool was officially launched. In June of that year, the BTC pool was introduced. To improve the mining revenue, ViaBTC Pool revolutionized the payment methods and invented PPS+, which was the first of its kind in the mining industry. Apart from the block reward, under the model of PPS+, miners will also receive the daily mining fee according to their contribution. This invention was widely approved by miners and mining institutions. By doing so, the pool became one of the world’s top 5 by BTC hashrate in less than 5 months since it was launched.</p>
<p>As a comprehensive crypto mining pool serving the world, ViaBTC has always adhered to the principles of security, transparency, fairness, and freedom. Through 6 years of dedicated efforts, the pool has introduced mining services for dozens of cryptos, including BTC, ETH, and LTC, and the invention of PPS+ has greatly improved the brand awareness of ViaBTC in the miner community. It is now the preferred choice among miners.</p>
<h3>6 years of concrete actions: ViaBTC insists on innovation</h3>
<p>How to provide better mining experiences to attract more miners has always been a challenge facing mining pools. Always offering new products and services, ViaBTC has committed to innovation and illustrated what the proverb “good wine needs no bush” means through concrete actions.</p>
<p>For instance, ViaBTC Pool offers multiple channels, free and paid, to meet the demand of different groups of miners by upgrading Transaction Acceleration; launches ViaBTC’s Hashrate Fluctuation Notification to free miners from keeping checking the hashrate since they will be notified when the figure drops to the set threshold; introduces Hedging Service and Crypto Loans to help miners mitigate the difficulty in turnover of capitals, more flexibly dealing with their funds, especially under extreme market conditions.</p>
<p>Always starting from miners’ rights and interests, ViaBTC has insisted on innovating products and offering a full set of products and supporting services, so as to provide miners with more efficient and convenient mining experiences.</p>
<h3>6 years of pioneering efforts: ViaBTC is backed by a strong team</h3>
<p>A company’s success depends on its team. ViaBTC has always upheld the principle of “the team is a company’s most important product”, and seen its team as its core competitiveness and the most iconic product. Through 6 six years of talent hunting, ViaBTC has built a strong and globalized team with group members having rich working experience in world-renowned Internet and financial enterprises. It is noteworthy that some of the pioneers in the crypto industry have joined the ViaBTC.</p>
<p>As a technical expert himself, Haipo Yang has attached great importance to code security due to his keen insights into security and auditing. Since its inception, ViaBTC Pool has never experienced any major security accidents. Backed by a strong team, ViaBTC Pool provides miners with a secure and stable mining environment to make them feel at ease every time they mine.</p>
<p>Although the mining industry is highly cyclical, ViaBTC will not stop forging ahead in spite of wild market swings. Even though the road ahead might be beset with thorns, ViaBTC will never give up. This is the best of times; this is the worst of times. ViaBTC will join hands with miners to embrace a new crypto age and create new glory in the next 6 years.</p>

</p>
<div>
<p class="p2">Bitcoin has been struggling to hold on to the $30,000 level for the better part of this week, failing more often than not. While there have been various reactions from different parts of the market such as the ETFs, perpetual traders seem to have taken this as a sign to hold off on their activities. What this has led to is a continuation of the neutral or below-neutral funding rates that have been recorded in the past couple of weeks.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Bitcoin Funding Rates Unmoved</h2>
<p class="p2">For the past few months, bitcoin funding rates have been tethering around the neutral and below neutral levels. This has been the case through both market recoveries and downtrends, although there have been periods of slight deviations where funding rates have recovered into the positive but even these have been short-lived.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/institutional-investors-seek-safe-haven-in-crypto-products-amid-market-uncertainty/">Institutional Investors Seek Safe Haven In Crypto Products Amid Market Uncertainty</a></strong></em></p>
<p class="p2">The last time that the funding rate saw a sharp recovery had been May 12th on the Binance exchange, after which funding rates had once more returned to trending at the neutral and below neutral line. This is interesting given that open interest in perpetual had surged to new all-time highs during this time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-491395 aligncenter" src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-26-at-11.31.57-460x348.png" alt="Bitcoin funding rates" width="460" height="348"  /></p>
<pre style="text-align: center">Funding rates fall below neutral | Source: <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://arcane.no/research">Arcane Research</a></pre>
<p class="p2">The 21 bitcoin funding rate intervals on the Binance and Bybit exchanges have been dominated by below-neutral funding rates. A total of 16 funding rates have been neural while 5 have been neutral funding rates. All this while, the perps have continued to trade at a reasonable discount to the spot.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Leverage Still Surging</h2>
<p class="p2">Even though bitcoin funding rates have been straggling, it has not affected the performance of open interest (OI). OI had declined significantly in the previous week but last week saw BTC denominated open interest retrace its steps and add 41,000 BTC. This brought the total denominated OI to touch new all-time highs of 290,000BTC, beating the previous May 4th high of 282,000 BTC. Just a week after open interest had dived more than 35,000 BTC.</p>
<p class="p2">Mostly, the surge in open interest has followed the times when the funding rates have been below neutral. At times where funding rates have been neutral or above neutral, open interest has usually been down.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/yLSP6OPX/" alt="Bitcoin price chart from TradingView.com" width="3284" height="1760"/></p>
<pre style="text-align: center">BTC fails to hold above $30,000 | Source: <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="http://TradingView.com">BTCUSD on TradingView.com</a></pre>
<p class="p2">What this suggests is that there will likely be more volatility coming into the market. This could happen regardless of whether the price recovers or continues to decline. However, the growth in open interest usually precedes a large recovery trend such as the one recorded during the July 26th short squeeze. So more than likely, it will be a recovery in price that will follow this surge in volatility.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p2">Bitcoin remains the largest cryptocurrency in the space with a market cap of $552 billion. It is up 5.10% in the last 24 hours to be trading at $29,200 at the time of this writing.</p>

<p>In many places around the world, schools cannot provide children with a sufficient supply of books due to poor financial conditions, nor can parents afford books. Meanwhile, the reading ability of children who have been raised in an environment without books is inferior to the average level, which negatively affects their life prospects.</p>
<p>Focusing on education for young children worldwide, CoinEx Charity will kick off Book Donation Worldwide on May 26, 2022, to improve children’s reading environment. The campaign will begin in Turkey and take CoinEx Charity to schools in poor regions across 11 countries, including Syria, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Nigeria, Malaysia, India, Brazil, Germany, and South Korea. CoinEx Charity will help schools build charitable reading corners and donate books to provide more reading opportunities for local children.</p>

<p>Find out more about the campaign at: <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/CoinExCharity">https://mobile.twitter.com/CoinExCharity</a></p>
<h3>A book that helps children succeed</h3>
<p>Books are a treasure house that’s full of information and wisdom — they help children succeed. However, most schools around the world do not have a library, making it difficult for children to explore the vast breadth of knowledge. Even in the US, which is the world’s wealthiest country, one in every 4 children grows up without learning how to read.</p>
<p>CoinEx Charity’s Multi-Million-Dollar Charity Fund is a charitable foundation dedicated to alleviating the “learning poverty” across the world. As International Children’s Day is around the corner, the fund will launch a charity campaign to build reading corners for and donate books to poor schools around the world.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-491453 aligncenter" src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Picture306-1.png" alt="" width="1266" height="723"  /></p>
<p>CoinEx Charity’s first 3 book donation events will take place in Antakya (Turkey), Damascus (Syria), and Bangkok (Thailand) on May 26, May 28, and May 30, respectively, and about 4,000 books will be donated to 7 local schools. Moreover, CoinEx Charity has also purchased bookshelves to build reading corners for each school. In June, the campaign will arrive in 8 countries, covering Vietnam, Indonesia, Nigeria, Malaysia, India, Brazil, Germany, and South Korea, with a total of about 9,000 books to be donated. During the campaign, it is expected that 13,000 books will be donated and charitable reading rooms will be built to provide more and better learning spaces for poor children, allowing them to read and learn with passion anytime, anywhere. Powered by an ocean of books, children will be inspired to find their dreams and strive for a better future.</p>
<p>CoinEx Charity has partnered up with the Syrian children’s aid organization Youth Association and the Malaysian charity MUDA Cheras, and will jointly host the campaign in Syria and Malaysia with its partners. This is the first cooperation between CoinEx Charity and an international charity organization. These new partners will expand the influence of the campaign and encourage more caring individuals and charitable organizations worldwide to join hands in improving children’s learning environment with the power of charity. CoinEx Charity also looks forward to building long-term, sustainable partnerships with more charitable organizations in the future. Together with its partners, CoinEx Charity will gather more momentum to convey the message of love and warmth and help more children grow up healthily and happily.</p>
<h3>Respond to the international call &amp; venture into charitable education</h3>
<p>Books open up an unexplored continent of imagination, and the increased access to books allows children to become more competent, which creates level playing fields across the planet.  UNESCO, the World Bank, and the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity are all calling for expanding the supply of books in schools around the world to improve learning conditions. CoinEx Charity actively responds to the international call and devoted more resources to charitable education to help poor schools improve the learning environment for children. Though they might seem small, books serve as a window on a broader world for children and help them realize their dreams.</p>
<p>During the campaign of Book Donation Worldwide, CoinEx Charity will donate over 10,000 books to impoverished schools in 11 countries to pass on love and knowledge. It also hopes to encourage more governments and charities around the world to help more schools build libraries and provide students with a decent learning environment via the power of charity. Education can transform children’s futures, thus making the world a better place.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-57976 size-medium" src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/8a5625c9-73fd-44b1-bf2a413ad89e2268.Original-scaled-e1653576938382-300x150.jpg" alt="Office buildings" width="300" height="150"  />The last few years have created a perfect storm of digitization and trust. Within the new Web3 partnership and ecosystem models coming to life now, powered by creator economy/token economy concepts, the full hope (promise) of the internet is on the horizon. Delivered in a digitally native experience (for or with a generation that won’t accept anything less), the future of enterprise blockchain has accelerated and evolved.</p>
<p>The blockchain market as we know it has matured to where we are seeing real adoption from enterprises, governments and financial institutions. Public chain technology has also become more resilient and scalable, and now with layer 2 solutions making them more useable, there is increasing experimentation and adoption in DeFi and for Web3 applications overall.</p>
<p>A hybrid enterprise blockchain solution can help organizations realize new business outcomes such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fine-grained security, privacy, auditable regulatory compliance and protection of competitive advantage</li>
<li>Agility to adapt to market changes and competitor moves</li>
<li>Single source of truth visible to all participating members in near real time with reduced friction, cost savings and efficiencies</li>
</ul>
<p>For the enterprise, unlocking the power of hybrid networks means thoughtful strategy, design and experience rooted in trusted data, tokenization, portability of assets and scalability of users. This digital convergence is the new table stakes for successful monetization in the digital economy and for de-risking an enterprise’s marginal dollar investment in the space. Today, we are delivering Web3 and metaverse consulting, leveraging years of market-leading client success powered by blockchain, working with both permissionless and private networks. We know that the potential has always been there for more. This week at Davos we’re delivering on that vision.</p>
<p>In one hybrid blockchain success story that we showcase this week, IBM Blockchain Services, together with our partner <a target="_blank" href="https://casperlabs.io/" rel="noopener">CasperLabs</a>, are trailblazing success together, leveraging hashed timelock contracts (HTLCs) to make organizations’ workflows and transactions more seamlessly interoperable between blockchain networks. This means a promise of future trust digitization, where in-enterprise blockchain solutions are precision engineered for the web3 world,</p>
<p><em>“We are excited to continue our partnership with CasperLabs, bringing to life real, measurable client outcomes powered by hybrid blockchain with speed, at scale. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/ipwe/" rel="noopener">IPwe</a> is the first of many new marketplace models in action for the industries re-imagined.”</em></p>
<p><em>— Anouk Brumfield, VP Blockchain Services, IBM </em></p>
<p>For clients of CasperLabs and IBM, this technology offers an exciting option, combining the enhanced security of a private consortium network running Hyperledger Fabric with the public verifiability and open market access enabled by Casper public blockchain capabilities. We’re very excited to see what we can create together!</p>

<div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
<p>Last week, the NFT Plazas team hit up Genesis, the first-ever gamified crypto event to take place in the Web3-rich city of London. Organised by <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nickel_factory">Nickel Factory</a>, a unique startup on a mission to bring decentralised communities closer together through immersive and interactive IRL events, the evening was jam packed with amazing talks, a gamified prize hunt, and various other performances that were a pleasure to witness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h4><strong>Interviews &amp; Alpha</strong></h4>
<p>As with our venture to the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nftplazas.com/nft-plazas-nfc-summit-lisbon/">NFC Summit</a> in Lisbon, Genesis was full to the brim with enthusiasm from all corners of Web3, meaning as official media partners, we were able to take advantage of an eclectic mix of event partners and attendees by getting up, close and personal through in-person interviews.</p>
<p>In doing so, we were able to retrieve <strong>alpha insight</strong> into many of the projects attending the event, including the likes of upcoming free-to-play NFT game ‘OpiPets,’ Web3 educators ‘Blockchain Sensei,’ NFT documentarists ‘Metacitzn,’ and more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h4><strong>Incredible Ambience &amp; Performances</strong></h4>
<p>Away from the interviews, we were able marvel at the holographic and 3D tech on show from tech company Unifyvsn, browse the array of <strong>NFT artwork dotted around the venue</strong>, and watch attendees immerse themselves in the QR-oriented gamified showdown.</p>
<p>In addition, visual effects specialists Escape Studios screened their multi-awarding winning picture ‘Shimmer,’ and Moses Concas, a winner of Italy’s Got Talent, was able to provide a (literal) breathtaking harmonica beatboxing performance, which was then followed by an interview with NFT Plazas as part of his music-come-street art NFT project ‘Imagine Action’.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When taking time away from the explicit ongoings of the event, the canal-side terrace of <strong>Studio 94</strong> (the event’s venue which was aptly situated in the vibrant, cosmopolitan area of Hackney Wick) provided an ideal space for interacting with the ever-interesting Web3 community of London. Here, drinks were flowing, music was blasting, and most importantly, networks were forming.</p>
</p>
<h4><strong>More From the NFT Plazas Team</strong></h4>
<p>As NFT Plazas continues to deliver the latest and greatest NFT news to our audience, daily and for free that is, we will certainly be attending more of these awesome IRL events. We would also like to say a big thank you to Nickel Factory for hosting the event, and allowing us to get our media kits all over it.</p>
<p>With this in mind, stay tuned to our <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYKElPbw0D1a6GE1McBH2iQ">YouTube channel</a> to ensure you don’t miss any of the <strong>interviews</strong> we conducted at Genesis London, and whilst you’re there, check out our array of fascinating interviews from NFC Lisbon.</p>

<h2>Things to think about before investing in NFTs</h2>
<p>What are your objectives? How much money do you need to consider yourself wealthy, and how much time do you give to attain this goal? Is there anything else you can do before attempting to become rich to obtain the same degree of satisfaction that you believe being wealthy would provide?</p>
<p>I’m talking about simple things like paying off your bills and cutting down on your expenditures. I know you don’t want to hear this, but it’s something you should think about before attempting to get wealthy via NFTs.</p>
<p>Because of their poor spending habits, someone earning $300,000 per year may have the same life as someone earning $30,000 per year.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the inverse is true. Someone earning $30,000 per year may live more peacefully and stress-free than someone earning $300,000 per year simply because they have no costs and do not squander money on items they do not need.</p>
<p>My argument is that if you can’t manage $30,000 effectively, how can you expect to handle $300,000, much alone $3 million? You will not.</p>
<p>After you’ve asked yourself these critical and realistic questions and resolved them, you can start thinking about a strategy to develop wealth using NFTs.</p>
<p>When selecting how to earn much money with NFTs, you must be entirely honest with yourself and everyone else your actions may impact.</p>
<h2>Is your only objective with NFTs to earn much money? </h2>
<p>Or, do you want to start your own company using NFTs and create a flourishing and rewarding profession for yourself?</p>
<p>Before getting wealthy with NFTs, it is critical to realize that there is much more to it than the NFT itself.</p>
<p>You need to address various challenges and solutions first and then begin working toward your goals daily, acknowledging that it will take a significant amount of time and patience to achieve something that many people will likely never succeed in their entire lifetimes.</p>
<p>Being realistic about your objectives and taking little measures every day to attain them will set you apart from someone who wishes they were wealthy but does not plan and execute to make it happen.</p>
<p>It isn’t easy to get wealthy. Getting money with NFTs may be much more difficult. Especially if you don’t comprehend the potential of NFTs, their capabilities, and the reality that the human(s) behind the technology, not the fact that it’s an “NFT,” is what gives an NFT worth.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve got that out of the way, let’s speak about how you can become wealthy utilizing NFTs as your vehicle.</p>
<h2>How to get rich using NFTs</h2>
<p>This is the question we’ve all been waiting for. How can you make money using NFTs? Please remember that I am not a financial counselor and that investing in NFTs is very dangerous. You do so entirely at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Here are several methods to make money using NFTs:</strong></p>
<h3>1. Buy and sell NFTs</h3>
<p>Purchasing NFTs with the potential to appreciate is one of the simplest methods to earn much money with NFTs. It’s straightforward. You buy an NFT for $5 and subsequently sell it for $50.</p>
<p>Although day trading is one of the most common methods for individuals to make money with NFTs, it is also one of the riskiest ways to invest in NFTs.</p>
<p>In general, day traders are only interested in purchasing NFTs at a low price (usually shortly after they become available) and then selling them for a profit of double, treble, or even more, with no regard for the NFT project’s long-term profitability (brand).</p>
<p>Remember that day trading is a full-time job. It makes no difference whether you trade equities or NFTS; you must keep a close eye on the market. You’ll know when it’s best to purchase and when it’s best to sell.</p>
<p>If you want to day-trade NFTs, make sure you have a certain amount of money set out for trading. In this manner, you won’t blow your whole bank account on something that may backfire. </p>
<h3>2. Investing in startup brands.</h3>
<p>You may invest in NFTs in the same way that you invest in equities over time or become a venture capitalist (providing funding to young enterprises). Investing in an NFT with a long-term perspective, on the other hand, might be much more challenging than day trading.</p>
<p>If you want to invest in NFTs with the long-term objective of accumulating money, you must do A LOT MORE research on the creator and what they are seeking to develop. You wouldn’t hand over a large sum of money to a random individual who claims to be able to make you wealthy, would you?</p>
<p>This is precisely what many folks in the NFT area are doing. It’s borderline gambling, in my opinion. Investing in a person without knowing anything about them is the fastest way to lose your money and your faith and hope in technology as a whole.</p>
<p>If you want to assist someone raises finance while still making a profit, you need to do your homework. Investing long-term in individuals who are developing something extraordinary is my favorite approach to support NFTs since I like builders.</p>
<p>There are a few fundamentals you should learn. Who is the NFT’s creator? Examine the individual’s job history. Were their previous efforts a success or a failure? These factors may reveal a great deal about how well your NFT investment will perform in the long term.</p>
<p>I wrote a blog post titled The NFT Boom | What Investors Need To Know. This article covers some of the most important factors I consider before purchasing a possibly good NFT. By good, I mean an NFT that will grow in value over time.</p>
<p>Finally, investing in an NFT with the goal of long-term prosperity requires extensive study, patience, and intuition. Remember that when you invest in an NFT, you invest in the NFT’s creator(s).</p>
<h3>3. Create your own Non-Fungible Token</h3>
<p>Of usual, the finest was reserved for last. Suppose you are a creative builder or someone enthusiastic about a specific issue. In that case, you may use NFTs as a platform to create something extraordinary and even earn a living doing so.</p>
<p>NFTs, you see, is just a technology platform that enables artists and businesses to design and market products. Anything could be turned into an NFT. Whether you are a painter, sculptor, fitness coach, or yoga teacher, you can utilize NFTs to provide excellent value to your customers, build trust, and be entirely upfront about your offers.</p>
<p>It is up to you, as the developer, to decide how and what you will give. Creating NFTs is, in my opinion, the most challenging method to get wealthy with NFTs, but it may also be the most gratifying.</p>
<p>If you reach the point where you’re earning much money selling NFTs, it’s probably because you put in a lot of time and effort to create a strong reputation with your customers and other individuals in your area.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you are developing and selling your own NFTs to generate money, you have chosen this as your vocation, and with it comes a lifetime of enjoyment and, of course, riches if you do it well.</p>
<p>As a result, I feel this option is the most rewarding and the most difficult.  If you believe that starting your own company and integrating NFTs is appropriate, you should read our blog “<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nftically.com/blog/what-are-the-best-nfts-to-invest-in-2022/">What are the best NFTs to invest in 2022?</a>” to invest immediately.</p>
<h4>Tips for Using NFTs to Become Rich</h4>
<p>Overall, we can employ several strategies and words of wisdom while generating money with NFTs that have remained true when it comes to wealth development in general. Let’s take a look at a few of these suggestions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before acquiring additional money, consider strategies to cut your present expenditure.</li>
<li>Pay off any outstanding debts.</li>
<li>Invest time in learning about personal money.</li>
<li>Don’t allow your emotions to get in the way of the truth.</li>
<li>Concentrate on investing in people and brands that you care about.</li>
<li>Make things you like to earn, not those that will make you the most money.</li>
<li>Make a budget</li>
<li>Don’t spend money you can’t afford to lose; instead, establish a certain amount of money you’re ready to risk to make more money.</li>
<li>Diversify your investing portfolio.</li>
<li>Always seek to learn more while being modest.</li>
<li>Assist those who are on a similar path as you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these suggestions may seem to be wide, I can assure you that they are incredibly beneficial and will eventually help you develop and retain your money.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>If there’s one thing I hope you’ve learned from reading this blog, there are many factors to consider before even thinking of being rich using NFTs.</p>
<p>Be truthful to yourself, others, and your objectives and expectations.</p>
<p>Although there are several methods to earn much money with NFTs—buying, selling, and building your own—all come with a high level of risk and a thorough grasp of the current market at your transactions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, how individuals generate money today with NFTs will only expand as technology advances and the various use-cases of NFT technology</p>

<p>Sprightly 81-year-old all-time rocker, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ringostarrmusic">Ringo Starr</a>, will take his multitude of talents into the metaverse, launching an <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nftplazas.com/learn-about-nfts/">NFT</a> collection and virtual gallery as he puts his faith in the technological world of Web3.</p>
<p>The former second best drummer in the Beatles’ first-ever NFTs will debut on <strong>June 12</strong> via <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JuliensAuctions">Julien’s auction house</a>. Arriving in the shape of five audio visual pieces titled ‘The Creative Mind of a Beatle’, each NFT will feature artwork and drum compositions created by the rocker and partnered with a signed print of the original item.</p>
<p>All in all, 20 NFTs will hit the market, made up of five designs of four editions each, with an unsurprisingly psychedelic explosion of colour offering a glimpse into the mind of one of the most prominent musicians in rock history. Each item will debut with an<strong> opening bid of $1,000</strong>, as he hopes to attract the interest of his army of fans. Ringo’s portion of proceeds will benefit the charitable exploits of the Lotus Foundation.</p>
