<p>When speaking of Web3 coins, some may automatically think of cryptocurrency tokens such as Bitcoin and Ethereum – but it’s much more than that. In fact, Web3 coins form part of a much larger ecosystem which many believe is the future of both the internet and finance as we know it. Expanding further than just being an online currency, digital coins also give investors the power to vote on issues concerning the relevant protocols.</p>
<h3>Starting With the Basics</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a> (also known as Web3.0) is the next generation of the internet, an ecosystem that is decentralized in nature, integrating the power of blockchains, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), cryptocurrency and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Although these concepts have been floating around the web for quite some time – some still find it difficult to fully understand what all of them mean. <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">Blockchains</a> are online ledgers that store information across a number of locations on a network, which makes hacking and data leaks a thing of the past. <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/17/business/what-is-nft-meaning-fe-series/index.html">NFTs</a> are one-of-a-kind, digital assets, which live on a blockchain, can be purchased and sold freely, or be held as an investment. <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cointelegraph.com/decentralized-automated-organizations-daos-guide-for-beginners/what-is-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work">DAOs</a> are the next generation of organizations, which function on rules that are encoded on blockchains, ensuring full transparency and decentralized, democratic governing bodies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What brings the Web3 ecosystem to life is Web3 coins, which will allow for all transactions to take place, through the use of crypto wallets. On top of this, many coins give investors voting power when it comes to important decisions and changes regarding the protocol. Seeing as so many different Web3 coins exist, some may find it confusing to decide which one/s to invest in. Whether a beginner or expert in the crypto universe, a vast number of Web3 coins exist which facilitate different uses across a number of industries, all focusing on different functions. Coins such as GAL, HNT and FIL are certainly the top Web3 coins to look out for in 2022, as they are making strides in bringing Web3 to life.</p>
<h4>1, Project Galaxy (GAL)</h4>
<p>Having launched at the beginning of 2022, the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://galaxy.eco/">Project Galaxy</a> ecosystem aims to provide users with an open, collaborative credential network. Being the largest Web3 credential data network in the world, Project Galaxy helps developers and DAOs to leverage NFTs and digital credential data. This is done through curators utilizing their native <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/project-galaxy/">GAL</a> token and signaling a credential data set’s value, which is then incentivized through the split of revenue amongst credential stakeholders. The main goal of the Project Galaxy team is to build better products and communities via the credential data network they’ve built.</p>
<h4>2. Helium (HNT)</h4>
<p><strong> </strong>Often being labeled as “The People’s Network”, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.helium.com/">Helium</a> allows for low-power devices to communicate with one another and transmit data over a network of nodes, called hotspots. This decentralized network focuses on powering  IoT devices, which are physical devices with the capability of connecting to the internet, such as light bulbs and thermostats. Think smart home devices – which you control from your phone. Through the Helium network, users know that their data is less likely to get hacked. The native token used on this network is <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/helium/">HNT</a>, which is used for all data and transactions.</p>
<h4>3. Filecoin (FIL)</h4>
<p>Time and again, global corporations have failed their users through poor data protection, leading to private data being hacked, spread and misused without their consent. <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a> is here to save the day, offering a decentralized storage solution that allows users to rent unused hard drive space through blockchain mechanisms. The native currency coin, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/filecoin/">FIL</a>, is used to record and make transactions on the platform. Made by <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> and being built on top of <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ipfs.io/">InterPlanetary File System</a>, this blockchain technology ensures top of the range, secure storage solutions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Whether a newbie or a fanatic of the crypto universe, Web3 does not limit itself to one interest or industry. Through Web3 coins, not only can users explore the future of the internet, but also ensure full protection of their data, while investing in the different ecosystems that are on offer. There is certainly no better time to get involved and invest than the present.</p>

<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has remained at a high value recently, a sign that could be bearish for the crypto’s price.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio On Verge Of Entering “Very High Risk” Zone</h2>
<p>As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/628e3e5078e9260215d55358">post</a>, the 72-hour MA whale ratio is near 0.90, the very high risk zone.</p>
<p>The “<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/correction-soon-bitcoin-whale-ratio-elevated/">exchange whale ratio</a>” is an indicator that’s defined as the sum of top ten inflows to exchanges divided by the total inflows.</p>
<p>In simpler terms, this metric tells us what part of the total inflows are contributed by the ten largest transactions, which typically belong to the whales.</p>
<p>When the value of this indicator is above 0.85, it means whales occupy a very large percentage of exchange inflows right now.</p>
<p>As investors usually transfer their Bitcoin to exchanges for selling purposes, such a trend can be a sign that whales are <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bearish-signal-whales-ramp-up-dumping/">dumping</a> at the moment.</p>
<p>The indicator’s value usually remains above this threshold during BTC bear markets, or fake bull for mass dumping.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Related Reading | <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-trading-volume-plummets-down-recent-top/">Bitcoin Trading Volume Plummets Down From Recent Top</a></em></strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, values below the 0.85 mark usually signify that whale inflows are currently in a healthier balance with the rest of the market. The ratio’s value usually remains in this region during bull runs.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio (72-hour MA) over the past couple of months:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/gIRR68lD_3008d1ed286dddf24188fff6495b59159efc19eb55116a08432da9d04fc202b7.png" alt="Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio " width="1280" height="666"/></p>
<pre style="text-align: center">It looks like the indicator has been at a high value recently | Source: <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/628e3e5078e9260215d55358">CryptoQuant</a></pre>
<p>As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has a value of about 0.89 right now, above the 0.85 threshold.</p>
<p>According to the quant in the post, values above 0.90 may be considered the “very high risk” zone. So, the current value of the indicator is very close to that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Related Reading | <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/investors-may-expect-downside-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-market-for-the-next-3-months/">Investors May Expect Downside For Bitcoin And Ethereum Market For The Next 3 Months</a></em></strong></p>
<p>In this month so far, the ratio’s value has almost always remained above the 0.85 line, with a couple of spikes above the 0.90 level.</p>
<p>The analyst believes whales are active right now due to the FED May Meeting Minutes, and if the ratio remains high in the near future, then it could spell trouble for Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-range-30k/">Bitcoin’s price</a> floats around $28.8k, down 2% in the last seven days. Over the past thirty days, the crypto has lost 30% in value.</p>
<p>The below chart shows the trend in the price of the coin over the last five days.</p>

<p>BTC mining has evolved from CPU to GPU and finally to ASIC, setting off a hardware “arms race”. Since more advanced mining chips are introduced, the hashrate of mining rigs has been on the rise, making mining extremely difficult. Meanwhile, hashrates are centralized by big mining farms and large institutions, and retail miners now struggle to gain the right of block updating solely relying on their own hashrates. To stay in the game, more and more miners choose to join a mining pool for stable mining revenue.</p>
<p>Before choosing one from many mining pools out there, miners should think about the following factors. First, brand recognition. In general, famous pools are more reliable because they are often highly recognized by the miner community. Second, user experience in both the products and the services the pool provided. A pool with a full range of products, in most cases, enables efficient and convenient mining experiences. All in all, brand recognition, and user experience in products and services are all backed by the tech capacity of the team behind the pool. Strong tech capacity allows a pool to offer a sound mining environment, so as to better safeguard the interests of miners.</p>
<h3>6 years of solid steps: ViaBTC is reliable and trustworthy</h3>
<p>In March 2016, Haipo Yang, the founder of ViaBTC, developed and deployed ViaBTC Pool on his own. Only two months later, ViaBTC Pool was officially launched. In June of that year, the BTC pool was introduced. To improve the mining revenue, ViaBTC Pool revolutionized the payment methods and invented PPS+, which was the first of its kind in the mining industry. Apart from the block reward, under the model of PPS+, miners will also receive the daily mining fee according to their contribution. This invention was widely approved by miners and mining institutions. By doing so, the pool became one of the world’s top 5 by BTC hashrate in less than 5 months since it was launched.</p>
<p>As a comprehensive crypto mining pool serving the world, ViaBTC has always adhered to the principles of security, transparency, fairness, and freedom. Through 6 years of dedicated efforts, the pool has introduced mining services for dozens of cryptos, including BTC, ETH, and LTC, and the invention of PPS+ has greatly improved the brand awareness of ViaBTC in the miner community. It is now the preferred choice among miners.</p>
<h3>6 years of concrete actions: ViaBTC insists on innovation</h3>
<p>How to provide better mining experiences to attract more miners has always been a challenge facing mining pools. Always offering new products and services, ViaBTC has committed to innovation and illustrated what the proverb “good wine needs no bush” means through concrete actions.</p>
<p>For instance, ViaBTC Pool offers multiple channels, free and paid, to meet the demand of different groups of miners by upgrading Transaction Acceleration; launches ViaBTC’s Hashrate Fluctuation Notification to free miners from keeping checking the hashrate since they will be notified when the figure drops to the set threshold; introduces Hedging Service and Crypto Loans to help miners mitigate the difficulty in turnover of capitals, more flexibly dealing with their funds, especially under extreme market conditions.</p>
<p>Always starting from miners’ rights and interests, ViaBTC has insisted on innovating products and offering a full set of products and supporting services, so as to provide miners with more efficient and convenient mining experiences.</p>
<h3>6 years of pioneering efforts: ViaBTC is backed by a strong team</h3>
<p>A company’s success depends on its team. ViaBTC has always upheld the principle of “the team is a company’s most important product”, and seen its team as its core competitiveness and the most iconic product. Through 6 six years of talent hunting, ViaBTC has built a strong and globalized team with group members having rich working experience in world-renowned Internet and financial enterprises. It is noteworthy that some of the pioneers in the crypto industry have joined the ViaBTC.</p>
<p>As a technical expert himself, Haipo Yang has attached great importance to code security due to his keen insights into security and auditing. Since its inception, ViaBTC Pool has never experienced any major security accidents. Backed by a strong team, ViaBTC Pool provides miners with a secure and stable mining environment to make them feel at ease every time they mine.</p>
<p>Although the mining industry is highly cyclical, ViaBTC will not stop forging ahead in spite of wild market swings. Even though the road ahead might be beset with thorns, ViaBTC will never give up. This is the best of times; this is the worst of times. ViaBTC will join hands with miners to embrace a new crypto age and create new glory in the next 6 years.</p>

</p>
<div>
<p class="p2">Bitcoin has been struggling to hold on to the $30,000 level for the better part of this week, failing more often than not. While there have been various reactions from different parts of the market such as the ETFs, perpetual traders seem to have taken this as a sign to hold off on their activities. What this has led to is a continuation of the neutral or below-neutral funding rates that have been recorded in the past couple of weeks.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Bitcoin Funding Rates Unmoved</h2>
<p class="p2">For the past few months, bitcoin funding rates have been tethering around the neutral and below neutral levels. This has been the case through both market recoveries and downtrends, although there have been periods of slight deviations where funding rates have recovered into the positive but even these have been short-lived.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/institutional-investors-seek-safe-haven-in-crypto-products-amid-market-uncertainty/">Institutional Investors Seek Safe Haven In Crypto Products Amid Market Uncertainty</a></strong></em></p>
<p class="p2">The last time that the funding rate saw a sharp recovery had been May 12th on the Binance exchange, after which funding rates had once more returned to trending at the neutral and below neutral line. This is interesting given that open interest in perpetual had surged to new all-time highs during this time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-491395 aligncenter" src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-26-at-11.31.57-460x348.png" alt="Bitcoin funding rates" width="460" height="348"  /></p>
<pre style="text-align: center">Funding rates fall below neutral | Source: <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://arcane.no/research">Arcane Research</a></pre>
<p class="p2">The 21 bitcoin funding rate intervals on the Binance and Bybit exchanges have been dominated by below-neutral funding rates. A total of 16 funding rates have been neural while 5 have been neutral funding rates. All this while, the perps have continued to trade at a reasonable discount to the spot.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Leverage Still Surging</h2>
<p class="p2">Even though bitcoin funding rates have been straggling, it has not affected the performance of open interest (OI). OI had declined significantly in the previous week but last week saw BTC denominated open interest retrace its steps and add 41,000 BTC. This brought the total denominated OI to touch new all-time highs of 290,000BTC, beating the previous May 4th high of 282,000 BTC. Just a week after open interest had dived more than 35,000 BTC.</p>
<p class="p2">Mostly, the surge in open interest has followed the times when the funding rates have been below neutral. At times where funding rates have been neutral or above neutral, open interest has usually been down.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/yLSP6OPX/" alt="Bitcoin price chart from TradingView.com" width="3284" height="1760"/></p>
<pre style="text-align: center">BTC fails to hold above $30,000 | Source: <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="http://TradingView.com">BTCUSD on TradingView.com</a></pre>
<p class="p2">What this suggests is that there will likely be more volatility coming into the market. This could happen regardless of whether the price recovers or continues to decline. However, the growth in open interest usually precedes a large recovery trend such as the one recorded during the July 26th short squeeze. So more than likely, it will be a recovery in price that will follow this surge in volatility.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p2">Bitcoin remains the largest cryptocurrency in the space with a market cap of $552 billion. It is up 5.10% in the last 24 hours to be trading at $29,200 at the time of this writing.</p>

<p>In many places around the world, schools cannot provide children with a sufficient supply of books due to poor financial conditions, nor can parents afford books. Meanwhile, the reading ability of children who have been raised in an environment without books is inferior to the average level, which negatively affects their life prospects.</p>
<p>Focusing on education for young children worldwide, CoinEx Charity will kick off Book Donation Worldwide on May 26, 2022, to improve children’s reading environment. The campaign will begin in Turkey and take CoinEx Charity to schools in poor regions across 11 countries, including Syria, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Nigeria, Malaysia, India, Brazil, Germany, and South Korea. CoinEx Charity will help schools build charitable reading corners and donate books to provide more reading opportunities for local children.</p>

<p>Find out more about the campaign at: <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/CoinExCharity">https://mobile.twitter.com/CoinExCharity</a></p>
<h3>A book that helps children succeed</h3>
<p>Books are a treasure house that’s full of information and wisdom — they help children succeed. However, most schools around the world do not have a library, making it difficult for children to explore the vast breadth of knowledge. Even in the US, which is the world’s wealthiest country, one in every 4 children grows up without learning how to read.</p>
<p>CoinEx Charity’s Multi-Million-Dollar Charity Fund is a charitable foundation dedicated to alleviating the “learning poverty” across the world. As International Children’s Day is around the corner, the fund will launch a charity campaign to build reading corners for and donate books to poor schools around the world.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-491453 aligncenter" src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Picture306-1.png" alt="" width="1266" height="723"  /></p>
<p>CoinEx Charity’s first 3 book donation events will take place in Antakya (Turkey), Damascus (Syria), and Bangkok (Thailand) on May 26, May 28, and May 30, respectively, and about 4,000 books will be donated to 7 local schools. Moreover, CoinEx Charity has also purchased bookshelves to build reading corners for each school. In June, the campaign will arrive in 8 countries, covering Vietnam, Indonesia, Nigeria, Malaysia, India, Brazil, Germany, and South Korea, with a total of about 9,000 books to be donated. During the campaign, it is expected that 13,000 books will be donated and charitable reading rooms will be built to provide more and better learning spaces for poor children, allowing them to read and learn with passion anytime, anywhere. Powered by an ocean of books, children will be inspired to find their dreams and strive for a better future.</p>
<p>CoinEx Charity has partnered up with the Syrian children’s aid organization Youth Association and the Malaysian charity MUDA Cheras, and will jointly host the campaign in Syria and Malaysia with its partners. This is the first cooperation between CoinEx Charity and an international charity organization. These new partners will expand the influence of the campaign and encourage more caring individuals and charitable organizations worldwide to join hands in improving children’s learning environment with the power of charity. CoinEx Charity also looks forward to building long-term, sustainable partnerships with more charitable organizations in the future. Together with its partners, CoinEx Charity will gather more momentum to convey the message of love and warmth and help more children grow up healthily and happily.</p>
<h3>Respond to the international call &amp; venture into charitable education</h3>
<p>Books open up an unexplored continent of imagination, and the increased access to books allows children to become more competent, which creates level playing fields across the planet.  UNESCO, the World Bank, and the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity are all calling for expanding the supply of books in schools around the world to improve learning conditions. CoinEx Charity actively responds to the international call and devoted more resources to charitable education to help poor schools improve the learning environment for children. Though they might seem small, books serve as a window on a broader world for children and help them realize their dreams.</p>
<p>During the campaign of Book Donation Worldwide, CoinEx Charity will donate over 10,000 books to impoverished schools in 11 countries to pass on love and knowledge. It also hopes to encourage more governments and charities around the world to help more schools build libraries and provide students with a decent learning environment via the power of charity. Education can transform children’s futures, thus making the world a better place.</p>

<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zcash is a fast and private digital currency that costs low fees and is perfect for mobile payments. The Zcash <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://z.cash/">network</a> (ZEC) aims to provide more privacy in transactions as compared to <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://crypto-academy.org/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and similar coins. It was launched in 2016 by a team of independent scientists, Electric Coin Co., and cryptographers. It provides the option to safeguard the information about the sender, receiver, and balance of a transaction to the users with the help of zk-SNARKS, a cryptographic technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Zcash has become one of the most popular privacy coins using <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://crypto-academy.org/what-is-blockchain/">blockchain</a> technology. There are several contributors from all parts of the world who support the development of the protocol and Zcash ecosystem. Hence it is becoming more strong and more decentralized in the processes of community funding and governance. Using the native token ZEC, Zcash empowers transactions on the whole network.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zcash (ZEC) Fundamental Analysis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zcash is a privacy-preserving <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://crypto-academy.org/top-9-cryptocurrencies-in-2022/">cryptocurrency</a> that transfers values anonymously and uses zero-knowledge cryptography. The protocol gives the options of shielded, transparent, and anonymous transactions to be there on the Zcash blockchain. The blockchain pays some portion of its block reward as the “Founder’s Reward” for funding the protocol development. The Founder’s Reward is currently allocated to the Electric Coin Company and the Zcash Foundation to develop the Zcash protocol, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most prestigious technical teams in the world launched Zcash, and many independent organizations get funded to novelize it. They have made it the first practical implementation of zk-SNARKS in a new form of zero-knowledge cryptography. It gives protection to the freedom of spending and saving money with the strongest privacy than any other digital currency. So, it is also called ‘HTTPS of blockchains’. It is now available for trade on top-known exchanges, digital <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://crypto-academy.org/cryptocurrency-wallet-definition/">wallets</a>, and a high number of applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the growth of the ecosystem and the entrance of more funds, Zcash continues to become more decentralized, with a much more diverse community and stronger technology. A Zcash development fund issues a total of 20% mining rewards to three organizations, while the other 80% gets allocated to miners. Community platforms, Zcash development funds, and initiatives collectively provide an incentive to the team and developers to increase their efficiency, fix bugs, provide a better user experience, build out applications, and pitch ideas.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Zcash works</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two types of transaction addresses in ZCash that are z and t addresses. The t-address are the transparent transactions that cause de-shield transactions, while the z-address represents private transactions that make shielded transactions between two users. You can get the ZEC token and trade it with other digital currencies using exchanges or brokers and then spend them or save them using only a mobile phone or a desktop and a digital wallet. In any social class, if you have an internet connection, you will have access to use Zcash as anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Zcash, users have full control over sharing transaction’s view keys; as compared to other public ledgers, as in other public ledgers, only the people with the correct keys can see the contents of a transaction. Here, transactions are independent of the cooperation from the other parties. Researchers from various worldwide universities contributed to input in the diligent science used in Zcash. Hence, they implemented the zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge, briefly known as zk- SNARKs. This makes the cheap fees possible for private digital money.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenomics</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ZEC is the native currency of the Zcash network. The total <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://crypto-academy.org/what-is-circulating-supply-and-maximum-supply/">supply</a> is twenty million Zcash coins and is often referred to as lowercase zcash. The transactions of Zcash are both transparent and shielded. Transparent transactions are the ones that are the same as Bitcoin. The addresses and transaction amounts are visible in them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in shielded transactions, addresses and transaction amounts are hidden for operating. Anyone who is using shielded transactions has the ability to disclose transaction metadata selectively for auditing and regulatory purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zcash mining rewards are divided between the miners and the stakeholders, including Zcash Foundation and a few of its employees. Miners get 80 percent of the reward, while the remaining stakeholders share the remaining 20 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zcash blockchain has been designed after Bitcoin. A similar halving procedure was adopted where rewards are halved at set intervals. In this case, the intervals would be four years apart. The next halving is approaching fast. Expected to approach in November 2022, the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://crypto-academy.org/what-is-bitcoin-halving/">halving</a> would cut the block mining rewards down to 3.125 ZEC, half of the current reward.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zcash Future Plans </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have not announced a future roadmap but have completed their commitments and plans made in the past, showing their dedication to achievements and accomplishments. Researchers of Johns Hopkins University wrote the paper “Zerocoin: Anonymous Distributed E-Cash from Bitcoin” to introduce the way to use zk-SNARKS to add privacy to Bitcoin in 2013. It was difficult to add such a complex privacy scheme to Bitcoin, so they decided to launch a new coin with this technology implemented onto it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer scientist Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn started it using the Electric Coin method. The developers decided to use a ‘trust setup’ or a ‘ceremony’ to use zk-SNARKS to create Zcash as it needs the developers to never leak secret data in any situation during the setup process. In 2017, Zcash improved the process by launching a second trusted setup. The improved zk-SNARKS technology facilitated more developers’ involvement. It also lowered the chances of failure of the trust set up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zcash also implemented the Sapling hard fork upgrade in 2018 to improve the activity and confidentiality of the cryptocurrency’s shielded transactions. In 2021, ECC announced the plans to shift Zcash away from its <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://crypto-academy.org/what-is-proof-of-work/">proof-of-work</a> consensus mechanism with a more interoperable and energy-efficient staking system. Zcash also decided to eliminate the trusted setup to add future upgrades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zcash team had also worked to make easier use of shielded transactions. As the transactions had become more guzzled up using higher than normal computational power and non-private transactions. For the future, Zcash has launched Halo and Halo 2 developments to offer the best opportunities for the privacy of this coin and resolve some of its most highlighted problems. Zcash is in conversation with the top privacy coins and will continue to walk ahead to gain privacy for itself and become top listed in this race.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zcash (ZEC) Price Analysis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zcash price is $85, with a <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://crypto-academy.org/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained/">market capitalization</a> of $1.2 billion. Zcash is considered a Currency under the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS) of Coindesk. It had hit an all-time high price of $1,624.58 the day right after its launch in October 2016. It also surged again to $800 in 2018. ZEC then reached $318.92 after a fall in 2020. Now, with a trading volume of $162 million, Coin Market Cap ranks ZEC at 45th in market cap rankings. It has the potential to achieve heights after every <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://crypto-academy.org/bearish-bullish-meaning-in-cryptocurrency/">bearish</a> price trend.</span></p>

CryptoSlate is hiring for a handful of positions!</a></p>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ErgoDex/status/1529168004965093384">ErgoDEX</a> team tweeted that they are two weeks into a testnet run and have been getting stable results. The next step is performance optimization and ironing out bugs before launching on the Cardano chain.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have been running our Cardano testnet for around 2 weeks at this point. We are now getting stable results with swaps, adding and removing liquidity on a number of wallets.<br />From here on out, our goal is to optimise the performance of ErgoDEX and fix any issues that may occur!</p>
<p>— ErgoDEX (@ErgoDex) <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ErgoDex/status/1529168004965093384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2022</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recent times have seen <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/hoskinson-discloses-the-new-challenges-facing-cardano-as-its-ecosystem-expands/">criticism</a> leveled at Cardano over its lack of dApp offerings, especially those pertaining to DeFi.</p>
<p>DeFi Llama currently shows <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano">ten</a> DeFi dApps on Cardano, four of which are inactive. Whereas Ethereum is home to 486 different DeFi protocols.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the imminent release of ErgoDEX will go some way to addressing concerns over the lack of dApps on Cardano.</p>
<h2>Who is Ergo?</h2>
<p>Ergo launched n <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cardanocube.io/projects/ergodex">2019</a> as an advanced Proof-of-Work (PoW) chain, featuring technologies such as zk-proofs and adjustable block size, with the added twist of being ASIC resistant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ergo is a proof of work (PoW) blockchain platform with Turing complete smart contracts that employs a number of advanced features like zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, oracles, and adjustable block size.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proponents of <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/asic-resistant">ASIC resistance</a> argue that it leads to greater decentralization, as there is no benefit to mining with ASIC machines compared to a GPU. As such, ASIC-resistant chains are minable by hobbyists and everyday people.</p>
<p>The team partnered with the commercial arm of Cardano, EMURGO, in <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cardanocube.io/projects/ergodex">2020</a>, to explore research and develop stablecoin technology and “the provision of DeFi applications.”</p>
<p>One of the outcomes of this partnership is the ErgoDEX, which is due for rollout soon. However, the Ergo ecosystem also includes the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/ergo-and-cardano-combine-to-create-the-ultimate-blockchain-platform-e26a01d99bfa">SigUSD</a> stablecoin.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits to Cardano?</h2>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-07-21-ergodex-a-cross-chain-workhorse/">ErgoDEX</a> will allow users to trade assets and provide liquidity much like any other DEX. But ErgoDEX will offer the added benefit of cross-chain liquidity and interoperability between the Ergo and Cardano chains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A noncustodial, decentralised exchange that allows a quick, effortless and secure transfer of liquidity between the Ergo and Cardano networks.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will also include <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/ergo-and-cardano-combine-to-create-the-ultimate-blockchain-platform-e26a01d99bfa">CEX-like features</a> such as limit orders, partial filling, and buy-back supports. Plus, by making use of “multi-stage contracts,” users can also take advantage of timed-release payments. This is particularly useful in giving users the option to cancel orders if something goes wrong.</p>

</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">American multinational business magazine Fortune has added <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://crypto-academy.org/coinbase-review/">Coinbase</a> as their first crypto company in their annual <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/fortune500/">&#8220;Fortune 500&#8221; list for 2022</a>. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Positioned in the 437th place, Coinbase joins Fortune&#8217;s 500 &#8211; thus making history as the first crypto company to do so.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fortune lists these companies in the current year; however, their listings are based on their 2021 incomes, and that is how Coinbase earned its position, regardless of current battles caused by market downturns.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to Fortune, $7.8 billion was the total amount of income of Coinbase in 2021. On Monday, Fortune Media reported that the profit threshold of the Fortune 500 list for 2022 was $6.4 billion, 19% more than last year&#8217;s limit.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase reported its first-quarter numbers showing a $1.6 billion in net profit and $430 million in a net loss. In contrast with last year&#8217;s net profit of $2.49 billion for the fourth quarter, it does show that Coinbase has had a difficult year so far.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The quantity of <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://crypto-academy.org/investing-vs-trading-crypto/">trading</a> has significantly fallen due to the drop in crypto prices in the last six months. According to Barron&#8217;s report, as a result of &#8220;crypto winter,&#8221; Mizuho Securities &#8211; Japanese investment banking and securities firm &#8211; reduced its Coinbase profit estimates from $6.7 billion to $5.6 billion for 2022.</span></p>
<h2>Coinbase&#8217;s Shares Market Performance</h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase shares are trading near all-time lows at $66 amid the market downturn. Earlier this month, they went down to as low as $40, 88% lower than their debut at over $328. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Due to uncertainty in the market, the company will not be hiring at the normal pace. This was confirmed by <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/emiliemc?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Emilie Choi</a> &#8211; President and Chief Operating Officer.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Heading into this year, we planned to triple the size of the company. Given current market conditions, we feel it&#8217;s prudent to slow hiring and reassess our headcount needs against our highest-priority business goals.&#8221; &#8211; Emilie Choi</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">COO and President Choi stated that this was not the first market downturn Coinbase has witnessed, and despite that, they have come out even more powerful each time. She then reassures that Coinbase is </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;in a strong position&#8221; and has a &#8220;solid balance sheet.&#8221; </span></em></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In spite of the recent events in the market world, we will have to wait until 2023 to see if Coinbase will once again join Fortune magazine&#8217;s 500 list. This company has been listing the top 500 profit-generating companies since 1995. US retailer <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.walmart.com/">Walmart</a> has been on top of this list for the past 10 years sequentially.</span></p>

<p><em>Ethereum struggled to gain pace above the $2,000 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH is declining, but it is still above the key $1,920 support zone.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Ethereum is showing a few bearish signs below the $2,000 barrier.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below $2,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</li>
<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,970 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could decline sharply if there is a clear move below the $1,920 support zone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ethereum Price Settles Below $2K</h2>
<p>Ethereum climbed above the $1,950 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. However, the bears protected major gains above the key <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-forms-bullish-pattern-2k/">$2,000 zone</a>.</p>
<p>The price started a fresh decline from the $2,020 swing high. There was a clear move below the $1,980 level and $1,950. Ether is now trading below $2,000 and the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-dips-2k/">100 hourly simple moving average</a>. A low is formed near $1,931 and the price is now consolidating losses.</p>
<p>On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $1,950 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,020 swing high to $1,931 low.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $1,970 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,970 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,020 swing high to $1,931 low.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ethereum-12.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-491387" src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ethereum-12.png" alt="Ethereum Price" width="1834" height="845"  /></a></p>
<pre>Source: <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">ETHUSD on TradingView.com</a></pre>
<p>The main resistance is now forming near the $2,000 level. A close above the $2,000 level could open the doors for a steady increase. In the stated case, ether price could rise towards the $2,085 resistance zone. Any more gains may perhaps send it towards the key $2,200 resistance zone.</p>
<h2>More Losses in ETH?</h2>
<p>If ethereum fails to recover above the $2,000 resistance, it could continue to move down. An initial support on the downside is near the $1,930 zone.</p>
<p>The next major support is near the $1,920 level. A downside break below the $1,920 level might call for a sharp decline. In the stated case, the price could dive towards the $1,850 level. Any more losses may perhaps call for a move to $1,800.</p>
<p>Technical Indicators</p>
<p>Hourly MACD<strong> – </strong>The MACD for ETH/USD is now losing momentum in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>Hourly RSI<strong> – </strong>The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.</p>
<p>Major Support Level – $1,920</p>
<p>Major Resistance Level – $2,000</p>

<p>ViaBTC has been one of the pioneers in the crypto industry with an illustrious track record. Recently we caught up with the CEO, Haipo Yang and asked him a few questions about the company, its mission and plans for the future. Read the excerpt of the interview below.</p>
<p><strong>Q [NewsBTC]: </strong><em><strong>ViaBTC is a pioneer in the crypto industry, having been around since 2016 – what was the idea behind launching ViaBTC?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>A [Haipo Yang]</strong>: I had my first introduction to Bitcoin and open-source software around 2011. At the time, fascinated by the technical principles of Bitcoin, I supported the view that we should facilitate industrywide progress by lowering the threshold of tech development via open-source coding. This led me to blockchain technology and the blockchain industry. Later on, I started to have some insights into the blockchain space. Back in 2013, I started running Bitcoin nodes and joined the building of the Bitcoin community. In March 2016, I completed all the code of ViaBTC Pool on my own in two months.</p>
<p>At the time, the inception of ViaBTC was motivated by factors relating to technology and product. Back then, the blockchain industry was in its infancy, and many technologies and products, including mining pools, were immature. Though the technical requirements for a mining pool are frequently underestimated, BTC mining pools are tech-intensive projects. Mining pools demand high stability and strong performance, which makes it a challenge to build a pool that’s sufficiently stable and efficient. In addition, mining constitutes a major part of the maintenance of the BTC network, and I wanted to drive Bitcoin toward a better future by building a mining pool.</p>
<p>These were the initial motivations behind ViaBTC Pool — I wanted to build a great product that would become the infrastructure of the blockchain world. Later on, more and more users chose to trust us, and our team expanded. Right now, ViaBTC is not just a mining pool. It is an ecosystem that covers CoinEx, ViaWallet, CSC, and ViaBTC Capital. The final goal of all these products is to facilitate blockchain progress by providing reliable services for crypto users across all categories.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong><em><strong>Your mission statement reads “Via Blockchain, Making The World A Better Place,” – can you tell us what this means?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The advent of blockchain and crypto technology has established a new order. Unlike traditional sectors, in the crypto market, smart contracts are strictly enforced by code, which is what we call “code is law”. This approach has created a more credible, transparent, free, and open market.</p>
<p>We believe blockchain technologies that advocate open-source development and freedom could foster more innovations. For example, popular crypto categories like DAO, DeFi, and GameFi are all blockchain-enabled innovations that can break the monopoly held by the giants and the existing market landscape by granting access to more ordinary users. ViaBTC’s job is to build the infrastructure of the blockchain world. As the gateway to the blockchain world for global users, ViaBTC helps more people enjoy the dividends brought by innovative blockchain technologies, thus making the world a better place.</p>
<p><strong>Q: <em>How Does ViaBTC fit within the broader ecosystem of products such as CoinEx, ViaWallet, and ViaBTC Capital?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> At the moment, ViaBTC Group runs 5 key business segments, including an exchange, a mining pool, a wallet, a public chain, and an investment branch, and provides services for more than 4 million users across the globe. The 5 segments cover the issuance, value discovery, circulation, and application of cryptos and their underlying technology, as well as ecosystem-enabled project incubation.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, these business arms are integrated and interconnected with each other. For example, miners using ViaBTC Pool can benefit from free, real-time withdrawals through CoinEx. This, coupled with mining revenue settled on an hourly basis, allows users to trade and transfer cryptos anytime at no cost.</p>
<p>ViaWallet also offers multiple block explorers, covering BTC, LTC, DOGE, etc. In addition, when transferring BTC in ViaWallet, users can tap into Transaction Acceleration, a function provided by ViaBTC Pool.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, with our ecosystem, users can mine, trade, and transfer cryptos and use DApps. This meets most crypto demands from a product level. CoinEx Smart Chain (CSC), infrastructure as a supplement to the ViaBTC ecosystem, offers developers and users a secure, efficient, low-fee underlying public chain. Backed by ViaBTC Group’s blockchain resources and tech advantages, ViaBTC Capital facilitates the progress of technologies, applications, and the entire blockchain ecosystem by providing funds, basic tech instructions, market promotions, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Q: <em>How does ViaBTC manage to offer low transaction fees and high mining profits?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> To earn high mining profits, miners must first ensure stable block yield. As Bitcoin is itself a distributed network, it takes time to transmit and broadcast blocks in the network. If two mining pools discovered a block at the same height almost simultaneously, an “orphan block” will be generated that pits the pools against each other — the pool that mined the orphan block would have been working in vain and could not receive the block reward.</p>
<p>To address such concerns, ViaBTC Pool optimized the broadcasting and transmitting process of the BTC network through its independently developed BTC client. Thanks to its high-speed block updating networks distributed around the world, miners can discover and broadcast new blocks more quickly. These efforts have lowered the orphan rate and improved the utilization rate of the BTC network. To date, ViaBTC remains the mining pool with the lowest orphan rate, which allows it to offer more steady mining revenue.</p>
<p>In addition, ViaBTC also boasts superior stability. During the 6 years since its inception, ViaBTC Pool has witnessed zero technical accidents and provided global users with a safe, stable mining environment that runs 24/7. Moreover, we provide the most versatile selection of payment methods in the entire mining industry, meeting the needs of different miners. For example, the PPS+ payment method that we invented not only ensures stable block rewards but also distributes miner fees to users, allowing miners to enjoy a bigger profit margin.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong><em><strong>What else does ViaBTC offer that competitors cannot?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> ViaBTC’s advantages mainly lie in technical stability and its superior product &amp; services.</p>
<p>As mining pools evolved over recent years, we have seen many changes in the landscape of top pools. Many new pools attempted to seize the market with subsidies but finally failed because when it comes to mining, stability outweighs everything else. If no block can be mined, all efforts would go in vain. Therefore, ensured stability, superior performance, fast block synchronization, and low orphan rate are the keys to earning the trust of miners.</p>
<p>Of course, products and services also matter. ViaBTC Pool has provided many industry-first services, including PPS+ and Transaction Accelerator. Moreover, we have always insisted on openness and transparency by offering mining statistics that are obtainable through various visual representations. The pool introduced Auto Conversion to ensure the mining revenue during market swings; it rolled out Hedging Service and Crypto Loans to help miners lock in profits in advance and ensure the smooth circulation of funds. Always focusing on miners’ interests, ViaBTC strives to offer more practical, effective products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Q: <em>What is the biggest milestone ViaBTC has reached so far? And what is the next major milestone ViaBTC is striving for?</em></strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> In May 2021, our BTC hashrate share ranked No.1 among all pools. I stress this record not because I want to brag about our ranking, but because I wish to thank all miners for trusting in ViaBTC and believing in our products. As you all know, miners are not always tied together with one pool and can withdraw their hashrates at any moment they want. However, the hashrates of ViaBTC Pool have been growing steadily and exceeded 20EH/s last month, which indicates the extensive recognition for our products and services among miners.</p>
<p>When developing a product, instead of getting obsessed with ranking and hashrates, we strive to improve our product and offer better services so that miners would be happy to stay and refer ViaBTC to their friends. Such word-of-month reputations are authentic. Therefore, for us, the most important milestone is every moment when our products &amp; services are recognized by users.</p>
<p><strong>Q: <em>How will ViaBTC remain competitive in the future?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> In terms of the mining pool, we will keep refining our products, building a global presence, and providing first-rate, stable crypto mining services for users around the world. Our efforts will extend to optimizing product experiences, including a series of improvements and upgrades in visual interactions and product functionality. Apart from that, we will also keep enhancing our bottom-layer tech structure, adopt solid security measures, and provide an efficient, stable mining network for miners.</p>
<p>We will continue to explore other business segments of ViaBTC Group from multiple dimensions, enhance the connections between the different products in the ViaBTC ecosystem, grant users easy access to the crypto industry, and provide more blockchain infrastructure services for crypto adopters.</p>
<p><strong>Q: <em>How have changes in the Bitcoin mining industry over the last several years changed the ViaBTC business model?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Over recent years, the mining industry has received growing attention, and the BTC hashrate has also grown higher at an ever-faster pace. At its core, ViaBTC Pool seeks to provide miners with stable mining services, and there hasn’t been much change in its business model. Instead, the pool focused on product updates. Right now, we aim to offer more innovative financial services like Hedging Service and Crypto Loans to meet a wide range of demands among miners.</p>
<p><strong> Q: </strong><em><strong>What do you think about the recent downtrend in cryptocurrencies?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The current crypto slump is subject to multiple internal/external factors, including excessive inflation rates around the world and the decline of global financial markets due to the stringent monetary policy adopted by the Fed. Meanwhile, the meltdown of Terra and the related ecosystem has also resulted in extreme market panic.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, we should focus on development over the long run. For years, ViaBTC has always focused on long-term prospects, getting itself through 6 years of ups and downs in the crypto industry and earning extensive user recognition. Meanwhile, looking back, we have noticed that the crypto market has always spiraled upwards. Today’s market has progressed in terms of technical maturity, market scale, and user base. As such, we remain prudent but also optimistic and will continue to build better products for users.</p>
<p><strong> Q: </strong><strong><em>What do you think the future of Bitcoin mining holds?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> As the No.1 cryptocurrency standing at the center of the crypto spotlight, Bitcoin and all Bitcoin-related businesses will receive more market attention and be favored by institutional investors. In North America, some BTC-mining-focused funds have been created. Meanwhile, many listed companies are also buying Bitcoin or even venturing into BTC mining and building large mining facilities. As a result, more institutions have forayed into BTC mining.</p>
<p>In an industry increasingly dominated by institutions, all BTC miners, mining farms, and mining pools have to enhance their tech capacity and build better products. Through intense competition, BTC mining will grow more specialized, and companies with inferior technologies and sub-par services will be outdated over time.</p>
