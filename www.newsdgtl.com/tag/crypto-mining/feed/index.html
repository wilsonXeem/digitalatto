CryptoSlate is hiring for a handful of positions!</a></p>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ErgoDex/status/1529168004965093384">ErgoDEX</a> team tweeted that they are two weeks into a testnet run and have been getting stable results. The next step is performance optimization and ironing out bugs before launching on the Cardano chain.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have been running our Cardano testnet for around 2 weeks at this point. We are now getting stable results with swaps, adding and removing liquidity on a number of wallets.<br />From here on out, our goal is to optimise the performance of ErgoDEX and fix any issues that may occur!</p>
<p>‚Äî ErgoDEX (@ErgoDex) <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ErgoDex/status/1529168004965093384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2022</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recent times have seen <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/hoskinson-discloses-the-new-challenges-facing-cardano-as-its-ecosystem-expands/">criticism</a> leveled at Cardano over its lack of dApp offerings, especially those pertaining to DeFi.</p>
<p>DeFi Llama currently shows <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano">ten</a> DeFi dApps on Cardano, four of which are inactive. Whereas Ethereum is home to 486 different DeFi protocols.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the imminent release of ErgoDEX will go some way to addressing concerns over the lack of dApps on Cardano.</p>
<h2>Who is Ergo?</h2>
<p>Ergo launched n <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cardanocube.io/projects/ergodex">2019</a> as an advanced Proof-of-Work (PoW) chain, featuring technologies such as zk-proofs and adjustable block size, with the added twist of being ASIC resistant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúErgo is a proof of work (PoW) blockchain platform with Turing complete smart contracts that employs a number of advanced features like zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, oracles, and adjustable block size.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proponents of <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/asic-resistant">ASIC resistance</a> argue that it leads to greater decentralization, as there is no benefit to mining with ASIC machines compared to a GPU. As such, ASIC-resistant chains are minable by hobbyists and everyday people.</p>
<p>The team partnered with the commercial arm of Cardano, EMURGO, in <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cardanocube.io/projects/ergodex">2020</a>, to explore research and develop stablecoin technology and ‚Äúthe provision of DeFi applications.‚Äù</p>
<p>One of the outcomes of this partnership is the ErgoDEX, which is due for rollout soon. However, the Ergo ecosystem also includes the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/ergo-and-cardano-combine-to-create-the-ultimate-blockchain-platform-e26a01d99bfa">SigUSD</a> stablecoin.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits to Cardano?</h2>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-07-21-ergodex-a-cross-chain-workhorse/">ErgoDEX</a> will allow users to trade assets and provide liquidity much like any other DEX. But ErgoDEX will offer the added benefit of cross-chain liquidity and interoperability between the Ergo and Cardano chains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúA noncustodial, decentralised exchange that allows a quick, effortless and secure transfer of liquidity between the Ergo and Cardano networks.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will also include <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/ergo-and-cardano-combine-to-create-the-ultimate-blockchain-platform-e26a01d99bfa">CEX-like features</a> such as limit orders, partial filling, and buy-back supports. Plus, by making use of ‚Äúmulti-stage contracts,‚Äù users can also take advantage of timed-release payments. This is particularly useful in giving users the option to cancel orders if something goes wrong.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US has become the dominant country for crypto mining, but that dominance isn‚Äôt reflected in the crypto mining stocks, which continue to perform poorly as the market plunges, Barrons </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/crypto-mining-is-flocking-to-the-u-s-51652816386"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cambridge </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) had revealed that the US accounts for around 38% of the global Bitcoin hash rate in January 2022; much of this progress is owed to China‚Äôs outright ban on crypto mining in May 2021.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ban led to crypto miners flocking to the US. However, the growth isn‚Äôt doing much for shares of crypto mining companies in the country.</span></p>
<h2><b>Crypto miner stocks are down</b></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marathon Digital Holdings (</span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MARA/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MARA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), the largest publicly listed crypto mining company, has seen the value of its stock drop from as high as $32.89 to the current $11.09.¬†</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month alone, the value has dropped by 46.94%, while its value has declined by 66.28% on the year-to-date metric.¬†</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riot Blockchain Inc (</span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RIOT/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RIOT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) has also lost 66.49% YTD and currently trades at $7.26, shedding $15.12 since the year started. However, it has recorded positive performance recently. Its value increased by 7.78% in the last five days and has gained 5.98% today alone.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same goes for Core Scientific (</span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CORZ/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CORZ</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). The crypto miner has lost 61.94% YTD and almost half of its value this month alone. The stock is currently trading at $3.97 on NASDAQ after gaining 3.12% today.</span></p>
<h2><b>Explaining the decline</b></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The massive drop in the value of these crypto mining firms throughout the year, especially in the last 30 days, can be tied to the </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-closes-7th-red-weekly-candle-for-first-time-ever"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enormous sell-off</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the market witnessed recently. Since most of these miners hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, their stocks tend to move in correlation with the crypto market‚Äôs direction.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from that, </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/marathon-digital-to-relocate-bitcoin-mining-facility-to-carbon-neutral-energy-sources/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining could also be said to be affecting their businesses. New York recently </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/new-york-assembly-passes-bill-to-temporarily-ban-bitcoin-mining"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a two-year moratorium on crypto mining, plus there was a recent </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/crypto-community-attacks-greenpeace-bitcoin-demands/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Bitcoin to pivot to the proof of stake consensus that consumes less energy.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Bitcoin‚Äôs price is steadily holding firm around the $30k range, fears of an increase in rates by the Fed to battle against rising inflation could lead to another streak of red candles.</span></p>

<div id="">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Bitcoin (<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) mining data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) has revealed that China has resurfaced as a leading mining hub.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This resurgence comes after the country banned BTC mining in the past year, citing BTC‚Äôs Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which is energy-intensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2022/bitcoin-mining-new-data-reveal-a-surprising-resurgence/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CCAF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, China‚Äôs ban on BTC mining saw the country‚Äôs hashrate drop to zero in July and August 2021. However, data from September 2021 to January 22 shows that China‚Äôs hashrate climbed to 30.47 EH/s in September. This resurgence made China the second-largest BTC miner, contributing 22.29% of the global hashrate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explaining how China has rebounded as a leading BTC mining hub, CCAF said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This strongly suggests that significant underground mining activity has formed in the country, which empirically confirms what industry insiders have long been assuming. Access to off-grid electricity and geographically scattered, small-scale operations are among the major means used by underground miners to hide their operations from authorities and circumvent the ban.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is worth noting that this data is based on a research methodology that leverages aggregate geolocation from massive BTC mining pools, which combine computing resources to mint new tokens effectively.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, individual BTC miners that use virtual private networks (VPNs) to hide their locations further obfuscate this data. Nonetheless, the researchers said the use of VPNs would have a moderate impact on the accuracy of the analysis.¬†</span></p>
<h2><b>The U.S. remains the top BTC mining hub</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following China‚Äôs BTC mining ban, companies in the field </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-miners-are-shutting-down-chinese-operations/?amp=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shut down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> operations and started an exodus to other jurisdictions with friendlier regulations and cheap power. The U.S. quickly became the leading BTC mining hub, ready to host these firms. CCAF‚Äôs recent data shows the U.S. generates 37.84% of the BTC network‚Äôs hashrate, up from 35.40% in September 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kazakhstan also accommodated a fair share of the mining companies that left China. The country‚Äôs hashrate climbed as high as 27.31 EH/s in October. However, constant power outages and a crackdown on unregistered BTC miners discouraged mining. As a result, the country‚Äôs hashrate plunged to 24.79 EH/s, bringing Kazakhstan‚Äôs market share to 13.22%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada‚Äôs market share also fell from 9.55% in August 2021 to 6.48% in January. Russia recorded a sharper drop in the same period, with its market share falling from 11.23% to 4.66%. While the country is an attractive BTC mining destination due to massive energy reserves, its central bank opposed BTC mining, discouraging miners from setting up shop in the country. </span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kazakhstan has imposed new reporting requirements that seek to determine the energy consumption rate by crypto miners.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The order requires every crypto-miner in the country to provide detailed information about their operations 30 days before commencing operations.¬†</span></p>
<h2><b>Kazakhstan requests new information from miners</b></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="http://zan.gov.kz/client/#!/doc/167156/kaz"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aim to determine how crypto mining affects the country‚Äôs energy grid. Digital mining businesses have to provide information such as technical specifications for their connection to the power grid.¬†</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also need to include information about mining equipment and any investment within the next 12 months. The requirements also make it compulsory for mining companies to provide information about the legal entity in charge of the operation, its contact details, IP, and physical addresses used for mining. Such a legal entity must reside in Kazakhstan.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the new reporting requirements, crypto miners will also have to submit quarterly reports where they update the initial information provided. In addition, companies that want to stop operating will also have to inform the government.</span></p>
<h2><b>Kazakhstan‚Äôs anti-crypto mining policies</b></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent months, Kazakhstan has changed its approach to dealing with crypto miners. The country had previously welcomed miners leaving China because of the new de-facto ban on crypto-related activities. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the impact of mining activities on its energy grid is leading Kazakhstan to rethink its strategy.¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government has </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/kazakhstan-is-cutting-off-power-supplies-to-crypto-miners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cut off </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">miners‚Äô access to power on occasion in recent months and begun¬†increasing tariffs.</span></p>
<h2><b>Crypto mining attracts tax¬†</b></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minister of National Economy </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/new-tax-proposal-in-kazakhstan-could-push-crypto-miners-out/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the government is planning to increase the taxes on crypto mining. Energy costs are currently ten times higher for miners, but it could become a lot costlier if the tax proposal should go through.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal also includes removing the Value Added Tax exemption on mining equipment. This new approach attempts to regulate the mining industry and shut down illegal mining, which has become popular in the country.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Financial Monitoring Agency, it shut down 106 illegal crypto mining operations in March, </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/kazakh-officials-seize-360-illegal-bitcoin-asics-amid-push-for-higher-mining-tax/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seizing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 67,000 pieces of equipment. The country has the second-highest </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hash rate after the US.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are speculations that the new policy change could force crypto miners to migrate to other countries like Uzbekistan, which is looking to attract miners that use solar energy by waiving income tax.</span></p>

<div id="">
<p>The Bitcoin Mining¬† Council, led by Michael Saylor, has hit back at a US Congress group that <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://huffman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/huffman-leads-colleagues-in-letter-calling-for-increased-oversight-of-cryptocurrencys-environmental-impacts">petitioned</a> the Environmental Protection Agency to criticize proof of work mining. The council‚Äôs letter focuses, in part, on comparing Bitcoin mines to computer data centers.¬† They aim to highlight that the EPA has no jurisdiction to dictate what happens inside a data center.</p>
<h2>Letters to the EPA</h2>
<p>The congress members had asked the EPA to evaluate the ‚Äúcompliance with environmental statutes‚Äù of proof of work mining.¬† The group claimed,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWe have serious concerns regarding reports that cryptocurrency facilities across the country are polluting communities and are having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. As cryptocurrency gains popularity, it is essential to understand the environmental risks and pollution associated with this industry,‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bitcoin Mining Council replied directly to the statement above, stating;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe statement above unfortunately confuses datacenters with power generation facilities. Power generation facilities are not datacenters. Datacenters which contain ‚Äúminers‚Äù are no different than datacenters owned and operated by Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Miners vs power plants</h2>
<p>The group‚Äôs logic attempts to separate the relationship between the mining hardware and the power used to operate them. Bitcoin ASIC miners are specialized computers designed to do one task exceptionally efficiently. A server at Amazon, Google, or Microsoft is also a computer designed to do a job to the highest standard. In their letter, the mining council stated no difference between the two. The EPA does not get involved with the nature of cloud computing servers and their software operations, so why would they evaluate the functions of a Bitcoin ASIC miner?</p>
<p>Further, the council highlighted that Bitcoin miners do not emit harmful emissions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúDatacenters engaged in the industrial-scale mining of digital assets do not emit CO2 or any other pollutants.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Renewable energy and EPA oversight</h2>
<p>The council also cited the recent Bitcoin Mining Council <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-mining-council-thinks-tesla-may-accept-btc-again-for-this-reason/">report</a> that indicated the use of renewable has risen to 58.4%. The eight-page response to the original request clarifies that there is a difference between energy generation and energy use. Should the EPA evaluate the use of energy? Currently, the EPA categorizes traditional mining regulations into air, asbestos, water, and waste. The overall energy usage does not come into question. Thus, it could be argued that if Bitcoin mining requires EPA oversight, then Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and gold miners should also be subject to further assessment.</p>

<p>A rising Bitcoin hash rate indicates the number of miners on the network is growing. This is often taken as a measure of growing miners‚Äô confidence in BTC.</p>

<p>However, considering the looming threat of recession, some even say depression, do the miners know something we don‚Äôt?</p>
<h2><strong>Recession indicator flashes red</strong></h2>
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin following the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/heres-why-bitcoin-may-have-to-deal-with-a-recession-in-2024/">2008 recession</a> to address central bank currency debasement and create an alternative to the banking system.</p>
<p>As an alternative to TradFi, some assumed Bitcoin would act as a risk-off asset. Yet recent data from Bloomberg shows the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/crypto-and-stocks-sink-as-global-deleveraging-kicks-in/">correlation</a> between the Nasdaq and BTC has never been higher. This suggests trouble ahead for crypto as stocks sink during recessions.</p>
<p>How likely is a recession? An often-used indicator of recession is the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/06/invertedyieldcurve.asp">yield curve</a>. Typically, long-term debt instruments pay higher yields than short-term debt due to the increased risk of lending over the longer term.</p>
<p>An inverted yield curve, where long-term debt pays less yield than short-term debt, is a strong indicator of a pending recession. Since 1955, a recession followed all instances of an inverted yield curve <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/2022/03/23/is-a-recession-coming-wall-street-signals-yield-curve/">except one</a>.</p>
<p>In late March 2022, the spread between the two and ten-year US government bonds tightened to just 0.2%. A continuation of this trend will lead to the yield curve inverting.</p>
<p>The economic outlook is negative with other factors in play, such as pending US interest rate raises and conflict in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>However, the rising BTC hash rate suggests miners expect the price of Bitcoin to go up, counter to what‚Äôs expected considering the state of the macroeconomic landscape.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the connection between Bitcoin hash rate and price?</strong></h2>
<p>There is debate regarding the relationship between the Bitcoin hash rate and its price.</p>
<p>On-chain Analyst <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://minerdaily.com/2021/btc-price-follows-hash-rate-no-not-necessarily/">Willy Woo</a> argues that Bitcoin‚Äôs price follows the hash rate. This line of thinking contends that a rising hash rate, as we are witnessing now, will lead to the BTC price rising.</p>
<p>However, others believe the hash rate follows price, in that it‚Äôs the price that drives miners to want to invest in expensive mining equipment.</p>
<p>Since November 2021, the price of Bitcoin has been trending downwards, yet over this period, the hash rate has been increasing. This relationship counts against the idea that the hash rate follows price because a falling price would see a drop in the hash rate, which isn‚Äôt the case.</p>
<p>But then again, this pattern also runs contrary to the notion that price follows hash rate because if this were true, then the rising hash rates that we are seeing now would equate to the¬† Bitcoin price moving higher.</p>
<p>The only conclusion to draw at this time is that the correlation between the hash rate and the price is weak.</p>

<div id="">
<p>The Bitcoin Mining Council has released a <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/bitcoin-mining-council-survey-confirms-year-on-year-improvements-in-sustainable-power-mix-and-technological-efficiency/">report</a> that confirms that 58.4% of Bitcoin mining comes from a ‚Äúsustainable electricity mix.‚Äù</p>
<p>Elon Musk famously <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1404132183254523905?s=20&amp;t=Hoa0_3d53Y6kNoECB6u2dQ">said</a> that Tesla would start <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-resume-bitcoin-acceptance-if-majority-of-miners-go-green/">accepting</a> <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> when</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>¬†‚Äúthere‚Äôs confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.‚Äù</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Mining Council and Elon Musk</strong></h2>
<p>Musk <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1396914548167233537">joined</a> a call with the council in 2021 to discuss the future of Bitcoin mining and its potential to move towards renewable energy. He stated that the result of the call was ‚Äúpromising.‚Äù Thus, there have been open lines of communication between the Tesla CEO and the council in the past. Whether the communication is still available is unknown, but Bitcoin investors will be keen to know if and when, Musk will again declare his support of the leading cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The rationale for exploring whether Tesla will again accept Bitcoin comes from the fact that when they first made the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1point5-billion-in-bitcoin.html">announcement</a>, the price of Bitcoin rose over 50% in the following two weeks. Then, just a few months later, Musk took to Twitter to announce that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin due to concerns that mining was too reliant on fossil fuel power.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tesla &amp; Bitcoin <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://t.co/YSswJmVZhP">pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP</a></p>
<p>‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2021</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin‚Äôs energy usage</h2>
<p>Several months after the announcement, a Chinese ban on bitcoin mining <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-btc-hashrate-rose-by-over-30-since-july-heres-what-it-means/">dropped</a> the global hashrate by over 50% and removed many fossil-fueled Bitcoin mines. Many criticized Musk‚Äôs decision, claiming that Bitcoin was already mined using a majority of renewable energy even before the closure of Chinese fossil-fueled Bitcoin mines.</p>
<p>Director of Growth at Kraken, Dan Held, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/danheld/status/1404176279310643207">replied</a> directly, ‚Äú<span style="color: #333333;">Over 74% is powered by clean energy.‚Äù </span>Further, in response to the move for Tesla to stop accepting Bitcoin, Nigel Green, CEO of the deVere Group, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nigeljgreen/status/1392742757677076482" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="60">said</a>. ‚ÄúThose issues surrounding the environmental impact have not come up in the last few months.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tesla has <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/tesla-gains-results-show-dependence-053528438.html">historically</a> made a lot¬†of its income through the sale of carbon credits. Critics <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-bitcoin-bad-for-the-environment-carbon-emissions-2021-5?r=US&amp;IR=T">questioned</a> whether the move was made due to a need to ensure Tesla continued to be capable of earning money through carbon credit sales.</p>
<h2>Will Tesla accept Bitcoin again?</h2>
<p>One of the critical factors Musk listed for Tesla to accept Bitcoin as means of payment was, the need for a positive trend regarding renewable energy usage in mining. Earlier this year, the council stated that <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/46-bitcoin-miners-employ-renewable-energy-sources-to-mine-bitcoin-bmc/">just 46%</a> of Bitcoin mining used renewable energy. A recent report said that the use of renewable energy by the¬† Bitcoin network,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Äúhad increased approximately 59% year-on-year, from Q1 2021 to Q1 2022, making it one of the most sustainable industries globally.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/">council</a> comprises core members of the Bitcoin mining community, including, Hive, Hut8, Riot, Marathon, Microstrategy, BlockFi, and Argo, to name a few. It can be argued that they have now shown that Bitcoin uses more than 50% renewable energy and that in fact there is a positive trend in this direction.</p>
<p>Your move Elon.</p>

<div id="">
<p>The World Bank recently <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/04/26/food-and-energy-price-shocks-from-ukraine-war">reported</a> that global energy prices could remain ‚Äúhistorically high‚Äù until 2024. They expect energy prices to ‚Äúrise more than 50% in 2022.‚Äù Given that energy is the only direct cost to the Bitcoin mining network, what might this mean for the future of <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/glossary/proof-of-work/">PoW</a> mining?</p>
<p>Speaking to Mas Nakachi, Managing Director at <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.xbto.com/">XBTO</a>, he told us,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>‚ÄúA surge in global energy prices will likely lead to tighter profit margins for bitcoin miners, lowering the overall incentive to mine bitcoin.‚Äù</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>A reduction in hashrate</strong></h2>
<p>The security of the Bitcoin network relies upon maintaining the hashrate, which is the sum total of the computing power assigned to mining for new blocks. If the incentive to mine Bitcoin reduces, this could potentially lead to miners leaving the network. As recently as 2021, the hashrate of Bitcoin dropped by 40% in a <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.in/cryptocurrency/news/why-bitcoin-mining-will-be-easier-with-drop-in-hash-rate-amid-china-crypto-crackdown/articleshow/83810948.cms#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20a%20drop%20in,level%20back%20up%20with%20time.">single month</a> as miners were <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-btc-hashrate-rose-by-over-30-since-july-heres-what-it-means/">shut down</a> in China. However, as you can see from the below chart, there is only a loose correlation between Bitcoin‚Äôs hashrate and its price action. However, this is a <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/the-bitcoin-hashrate-soars-to-a-new-all-time-high-what-happens-next/">hotly debated</a> topic by Bitcoin Maxis. The drop in hashrate in October 2020 did nothing to stop the bull run that came directly after. Further, as the hashrate dropped drastically in June 2021, its price remained steady, hitting a new all-time high just months later.</p>
<p><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-235341 size-full" src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-2022-04-30-111257.jpg" alt="bitcoin hashrate 2022" width="1530" height="819"  /></noscript><img loading="lazy" class="lazyload aligncenter wp-image-235341 size-full" src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-2022-04-30-111257.jpg" alt="bitcoin hashrate 2022" width="1530" height="819"  data-/></p>
<p>Markets do not panic if the hashrate drops because there is an in-built safeguard in Bitcoin‚Äôs code called ‚Äòdifficulty.‚Äô If the number of network participants drops, so does the amount of power required to mine a block. The same is true in reverse; if the amount of power added to the network increases, same does the difficulty. This stops attacks on the network due to a sudden influx in mining power or an unprecedented event, causing many miners to leave the network, as happened in China. Kevin Zhang, from leading Bitcoin mining pool Foundry, told <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/24/mining-bitcoin-could-get-easier-after-china-crypto-crackdown.html">CNBC</a> after the Chinese crackdown on miners,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúAs more hashrate falls off the network, difficulty will adjust downwards, and the hashrate that remains active on the network will receive more for their proportional share of the mining rewards,‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Increased difficulty</h2>
<p>Further, Bitcoin difficulty hit an <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-mining-network-difficulty-reaches-new-all-time-high/">all-time high</a> recently, and thus the amount of power required to mine a block increased. The more computing power added to the network, the more difficult it becomes to mine a block. This is a mechanism built to ensure that Bitcoin‚Äôs supply remains constant. Because of this, we know that it will take over a hundred years to mine the remaining 2 million Bitcoin. However, as Samuel Becker from <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/bitcoin-hash-rate/">Sofi Learn</a> explains, ‚Äúas Bitcoin mining becomes more difficult, the process eats up more electricity.‚Äù</p>
<p>Participation and revenue from Bitcoin mining are<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cryptocurrency-mining-software-market-2022-094300855.html#:~:text=According%20to%20our%20latest%20research,for%20the%20next%20five%20years."> expected to rise</a> over the next few years to hit $4.5 billion by 2026. An increase in miners will increase the difficulty and thus reduce the Bitcoin reward per hash. Currently, the reward per 100TH/s is 0.00042199BTC per day ($16.20) without considering the electricity costs.</p>
<h2>Cost of production</h2>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ir.greenidge.com/static-files/0660fd59-e66d-461d-bf40-7c222e361a8c">cost per megawatt</a> of energy for large Bitcoin miners such as Hut8, Greenridge, Hive, and Marathon ranges from $22 ‚Äì $40. This means that for a company such as Hut8, with 2.54 E/H of mining power. The electricity costs for the company totaled $36.9 million in 2019, with a profit of $172,124. Their annual report shows that if this price had risen by 30%, they would have made a $10.8 million loss. Granted, the cost of Bitcoin in 2019 was just $9,300 at its peak, and they notoriously hodl their Bitcoin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their 2021 annual information reported that ‚Äúthe only seasonality that the Company experiences is related to potential changes in electricity prices based on volatility in market natural gas prices, which affects all of Hut 8‚Äôs facilities.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Natural gas prices have been up 100% since December 2021, while the price of Bitcoin is down 25%. The cost of fueling mining operations has gone up 100% (assuming this cost has been passed on to the miner), while the return dropped by 25% when valued in dollars.</p>
<figure id="attachment_235350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-235350" style="width: 1584px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-235350 size-full" src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-2022-04-30-130048.jpg" alt="natural gas prices" width="1584" height="1151"  /></noscript><img loading="lazy" class="lazyload wp-image-235350 size-full" src="https://www.newsdgtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-2022-04-30-130048.jpg" alt="natural gas prices" width="1584" height="1151"  data-/><figcaption id="caption-attachment-235350" class="wp-caption-text">Source: <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=CURRENCYCOM%3ANATURALGAS">TradingView </a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Further, Hut8 states that in the risk factors attributed to their business model, ‚ÄúThe Company may face risks of disruptions to its supply of electrical power and an increase of electricity rates.‚Äù However, they list several agreements in place, indicating that fixed-price contracts have been put in place to mitigate this risk. Another large miner, Marathon, also states in their <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ir.marathondh.com/sec-filings/annual-reports##document-25279-0001493152-22-006446-2">annual report</a> that they pay a fixed cost of $0.042 per kWh for their electricity consumption.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Thus, it seems likely that the major miners who operate, in part, to help secure the network have fixed-priced energy contracts in place that will not put them at risk of bearing the increased cost of energy reported by the World bank. However, there is still a risk that the energy companies themselves may not be able to honor the agreements, as we saw several UK energy companies <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/energy/failed-uk-energy-suppliers-update/">went bust</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>Regardless, it would take a doomsday scenario for Bitcoin miners leaving the network to have any real impact. If losing 65% of Bitcoin mining power in 2021 was just a speed bump, then it is likely that an energy crisis would have a similar effect.</p>
<p>Natural gas prices were currently at the highest level since the creation of Bitcoin, yet in 2008 the price was 100% higher than it is now. Lastly, according to Ark Investments, 76% of Bitcoin‚Äôs mining power comes from <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/04/26/ark-investments-analyst-says-76-percent-of-bitcoin-miners-are-using-renewable-energy.html?__source=sharebar|twitter&amp;par=sharebar">renewable energy</a>. The sun and wind don‚Äôt care about global economic unrest, and neither will the production costs for renewable energy miners. The only miners who look to be affected by an energy crisis are individual, private miners who rely on the traditional energy grid. Anyone mining Bitcoin at home with an ASIC miner may need to move to renewable energy or incur high costs in the coming 24 months.</p>

<div id="">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York State Assembly has passed a </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/A7389"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mining moratorium bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pause all crypto mining development for two years. The essence of the moratorium is to give the state enough time to examine the impact of mining in the state.</span></p>
<h2><b>Two-year moratorium on carbon-fueled mining</b></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assemblymember Anna Kelles sponsored the Bill designed to prevent the issuance of new permits for all </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/analyzing_the_bitcoin_mining-_industry_panorama_following_btcs_price_drop/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto mining</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> activities in the state, especially those that use carbon-based fuel.¬†</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mining sites in the state that currently use carbon-based fuel will not get a permit renewal to expand their operations. According to the sponsor, the moratorium gives the state a chance to meet the standards set out in the 2019 New York Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA).</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bill had members of the house divided, and pro-crypto advocates argued that it bans crypto mining activities generally. However, Kelles insisted that the Bill would only apply to fossil fuel-powered mining facilities.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It would not in any way restrict the ability to buy, sell, invest, or use crypto currencies in New York State. This bill only pertains to large-scale cryptomining in power plants that use fossil-fuel based energy sources behind the meter. <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://t.co/UfMipwQpPG">https://t.co/UfMipwQpPG</a></p>

</blockquote>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pro-crypto legislators kick against the bill</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/new-york-lawmaker-proposes-2-year-moratorium-on-power-plants-to-stop-growth-of-crypto-mining/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been in the house for a while, the crypto industry has kicked against it vehemently. An earlier version wanted a moratorium of 3 years but failed to get the support of members of the Assembly and was eventually abandoned in June 2021.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some members of the Assembly believe the Bill will hurt New York. One of them is Republican Assemblyman Robert Smullen, who described it as an ‚Äúanti-tech‚Äù law ‚Äúdisguised as an environmental law.‚Äù</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his argument, he claimed that the Bill could force crypto miners to move out of New York to other states. He further argued that he thinks the state should be embracing these industries.</span></p>
<h2>Crypto miners speak out against the Bill</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above sentiment echoes the crypto industry‚Äôs view that the moratorium could affect New York‚Äôs position as a leader in the industry.¬†</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Foundry recently surpassed 100 employees, with plans to double that number by the end of the year. A moratorium on <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#bitcoin</a> mining will take NY out of the game as our industry flourishes elsewhere, generating jobs and tax dollars in other states that are more welcoming. <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://t.co/o4LYkbHjtB">https://t.co/o4LYkbHjtB</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This view was also echoed by its CEO, Mike Colyer, who said that around $3 ‚Äì $5 billion would be spent on crypto mining in the US within the next two years, and the New York assembly should be working on ‚Äústudying the industry, not banning it.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bill has not become law yet. The Assembly is the lower chamber of the </span><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/fud-incoming-the-new-york-times-calls-crypto-the-new-subprime/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislature.

<p><strong>‚ÄúWe view the battle going on in New York right now as a litmus test of what other states may do,‚Äù</strong></p>

<h2>Crypto mining from old power plants</h2>
<p>Companies in New York are <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-miners-are-giving-new-life-to-old-fossil-fuel-power-plants-11621594803?mod=article_inline">revitalizing</a> old fossil fuel power plants to take advantage of the arbitrage between the cost of energy and the price of Bitcoin (<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) since the recent bull market. Some have since been converted from coal-fired to natural gas, which power generators used to mine Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Greenridge Generation has done precisely this and is the focus of Kelles complaints. They have pivoted towards Bitcoin mining as they can mine Bitcoin at just <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ir.greenidge.com/static-files/0660fd59-e66d-461d-bf40-7c222e361a8c">$22/ MWh</a> ‚Äî roughly 5x less than the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.energybot.com/electricity-rates-by-state.html#:~:text=The%20Average%20Electricity%20Rate%20in,30.55%20cents%20per%20kilowatt%2Dhour.">average price</a> paid by U.S. residents. Mining companies use their direct energy cost to mine Bitcoin, which lowers the energy cost.</p>
<p>Greenridge ‚Äúoperates an integrated 106 MW gas-fired power plant and bitcoin mining operation in Upstate New York.‚Äù A major backer of Greenridge is Atlas Holdings which manages an additional 1000MW of power stations in the New York and New England areas.</p>
<p>Interestingly, according to its investor relations documents, Greenridge claims to have been entirely <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ir.greenidge.com/events-presentations/presentations">carbon natural</a> since 2021. Carbon neutrality seems to be left out of criticisms of crypto mining and its energy use. However, as with many carbon-neutral businesses, this is done by purchasing carbon credits rather than being emission-free. Regardless of this stance, they require a new air quality license to continue mining Bitcoin in the state.</p>
<p>A local conservation group is lobbying to block the renewal of Greenidge‚Äôs permit.</p>
<h2>Mining‚Äôs impacts on local population</h2>
<p>A <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/18/1049331/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-cryptomining-new-york/">report</a> from 2017 ‚Äì 2018 covering the effects of mining on local economies stated about Plattsburgh, New York:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúCrypto mining in upstate New York increased annual electric bills by about $165 million for small businesses and $79 million for individuals‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The increase in commerce from the influx of Bitcoin miners ‚Äî due to ‚Äúample access to power‚Äù ‚Äî has not helped the local economy. Bitcoin mining is not human resource-heavy and thus does not create many jobs for residents.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some of these residents are affected by the mining operations in <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/18/1049331/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-cryptomining-new-york/">other ways</a>.</p>
<h2>Energy efficiency of Bitcoin vs. fiat</h2>
<p>There is a drive for Bitcoin to utilize more renewable energy worldwide. However, more focus seems to be given to the energy use of crypto than to traditional industry.</p>
<p>The cities of London, Manhattan, and Shanghai are home to the world‚Äôs largest stock exchanges. Each of these requires staffing, servers, heating, lighting, cleaning, waste management, catering, and many other services that require energy. Further, people in these industries have a personal carbon footprint outside of their workdays and commute.</p>
<p>These factors create energy usage for just one small part of the traditional fiat financial system. The energy cost is indirect. Machines are used to print money, but most fiat transactions are online through internet banking.</p>
<p>With Bitcoin, there is a highly efficient correlation between energy and currency creation. It <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/18/1049331/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-cryptomining-new-york/">costs</a> a company such as Greenridge <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://whattomine.com/coins/1-btc-sha-256?hr=9000000.0&amp;p=320000.0&amp;fee=0.0&amp;cost=0.02&amp;cost_currency=USD&amp;hcost=0.0&amp;span_br=1h&amp;span_d=&amp;commit=Calculate">around</a> $4,200 to mine 1BTC using modern ASIC miners. At today‚Äôs price of roughly $40,000, that is a solid ROI for any business.</p>
<p>Further, it works outs to around 400wh per $1 of Bitcoin mined. How much energy does it take to create a single dollar in the U.S.? Bitcoin does not require many human resources; there is very little maintenance once it is running. One could argue that Bitcoin is penalized for the transparency and direct efficiency of its use of power.</p>
<p>Every 400w over an hour creates $1 of Bitcoin. Anyone can do the calculation with freely available information. Moreso, this energy usage can (and perhaps should) be from wholly renewable sources. We cannot say the same about the fiat system, gold production, or lithium mining. Will we stop using gold or creating lithium batteries?</p>
