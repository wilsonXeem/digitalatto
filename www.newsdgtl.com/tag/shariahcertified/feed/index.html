<p>Starting May 19, Qatari citizens and residents can open accounts with CoinMENA and link their bank accounts to it CoinMENA has become the first regional digital assets exchange to operate in Qatar.</p>



<p>Starting May 19, Qatari citizens and residents can open accounts with CoinMENA and access all the features within the platform, including linking their bank accounts to their CoinMENA wallets in order to enable streamlined deposits and withdrawals.</p>



<p>The Bahrain-headquartered firm recently became the first onshore licensed crypto exchange to introduce limit trading, enabling the platform’s users to set the price at which they wish to buy and sell crypto.</p>



<p>Users in Qatar will also be able to utilize the recently added features including withdrawing USDT via the TRON network for lower fees, and earning bonus rewards when they invite their friends through its referral program.</p>



<p>“We are delighted to become the first crypto exchange to offer our services in Qatar. Investors have been asking about our plans to enter the country for some time now, so this news represents a major milestone in our long-term geographic market expansion plans,” said CoinMENA co-founders Dina Saman and Talal Tabbaa. “Our team is constantly striving to onboard new countries and introduce new features to a wider audience.”</p>



<p>In January, the Central Bank of Bahrain issued the exchange, with a “Crypto Asset Services Company License – Category 2”. The Bahrain-headquartered digital asset exchange received the license after reportedly meeting all of the operational, technical, and security requirements outlined by the CBB. CoinMENA is a Sharia-compliant exchange, certified by the Shariyah Review Bureau. </p>
