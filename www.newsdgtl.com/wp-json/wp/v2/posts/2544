Ripple Began<\/h2>\n<p>Between 2013 and 2020, Ripple Labs raised $1.3 billion in capital through the sale of XRP tokens.<\/p>\n<p>When the SEC filed a complaint against Ripple near the end of 2020, there were no indications from the SEC that Ripple was under scrutiny.<\/p>\n<p>And Ripple was already trading on over 200 exchanges at the time.<\/p>\n<p>The SEC, on the other hand, concluded that Christian Larsen, Ripple\u2019s co-founder, and Bradley Garlinghouse, Ripple\u2019s current CEO, illegally raised cash because XRP was not a registered securities but was offered to investors around the world.<\/p>\n<h2>Legal Showdown Until Before Christmas<\/h2>\n<p>The joint letter\u2019s new provisions require the defense to file statements and any motions against expert witnesses by August 2, while objections must be filed by November 2. Additionally, any resistance must be responded to by December 20.<\/p>\n<p>The revised timeline follows the SEC\u2019s request for an extension to file an objection to Judge Netburn\u2019s decision on the Motion for Reconsideration of the DPP Ruling. This was the regulator\u2019s second request for an extension in the matter.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/ZS5VO2AJ\/\" width=\"1834\" height=\"818\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">XRP total market cap at $31.56 billion on the daily chart | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p>Defense attorney James Filan shared a tweet from Ripple defense lawyer Stuart Alderoty, who said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>\u201cTo all that have been following the case thus far \u2013 thank you.

The crypto declined 1.70 percent on Saturday and ended the day at $0.7055, down 2.06 percent from Friday\u2019s close.<\/p>\n<p>On April 24, Ripple\u2019s XRP fell for the fourth consecutive day, and the latest update had no discernible effect on the price.<\/p>\n<p>XRP must break over the pivot point of $0.7117 in order to reach the first major resistance level at $0.7204. To break out of the $0.7150 range, XRP would require wide crypto market support.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Suggested Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/crypto\/ripple-getting-bullish-positive-trends-point-to-a-solid-year-for-xrp\/\">Ripple Getting Bullish, Positive Trends Point To A Solid Year For XRP<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The cryptocurrency is now trading at 82% of its all-time high of $3.84194.<\/p>\n<p>Through the week, XRP trailed the broader crypto market, which was weighed down by market risk aversion.<\/p>\n<p>XRP has also been pushed down by news updates on the Ripple vs. SEC case, which has challenged support at $0.70.<\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Featured image from Times Tabloid, chart from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/sec-ripple-agree-to-extend-legal-battle\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Executives of Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have agreed to prolong the timeline of their lawsuit and postpone court proceedings until the end of 2022, implying that their legal standoff would likely last well into next year.
