However, some experts have been providing bulls with hope as long as the crypto market can sustain its current levels.<\/p>\n<p>A pseudonyms trader pointed at ETH\u2019s price current structure and determined that it can trend upwards from its present price.

The pseudonym trader said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You may think I\u2019m still being biased bullish but I can\u2019t call this chart bearish yet. OBV has held support on the daily, and we still have made a higher low. Break one of those and I lose my bullish thesis.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the past, these long periods of consolidation in the price of Ethereum and its OBV have been followed by important rallies. In May and June last year, the price of large cryptocurrencies trended to the downside and then move sideways before re-entering uncharted territory.<\/p>\n<h2>Should You Sell Ethereum At Its Current Levels?<\/h2>\n<p>The crypto market, as many operators have been pointing out across social media platforms, is moving in tandem with traditional equities. These assets are reacting to a negative earnings season for major companies and the possibility of an aggressive shift in monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED).<\/p>\n<p>The Nasdaq 100 index, highly correlated with Ethereum and the crypto market, has been displaying weakness as it trends further downwards in 2022. As long as this index remains on a bearish trend, crypto seems unlikely to regain its strength.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/ethereum\/will-the-ethereum-merge-skyrocket-eth\/\">Will The Ethereum Merge Skyrocket ETH?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>However, current levels could operate as a short-term bottom for ETH and BTC prices.
