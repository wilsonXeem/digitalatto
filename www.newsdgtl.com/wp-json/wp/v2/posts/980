This dominance of altcoins over Bitcoin could happen after a BTC bull run as other digital tokens make breakthroughs and gain dominance over the market.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin seems to be making big moves this week as it broke its 3-month consolidation. A bullish ascending triangle pattern is on the lookout along with a possible around-$51k target. In the crypto market, coins usually follow other coins\u2019 moves. This means that Ethereum can follow Bitcoin\u2019s price movements, and then other altcoins as well.<\/p>\n<p>It can be similar for the smaller coins. If some altcoins are greatly outperforming, others can follow. The movement in question seems to be whether BTC can truly go above its $48k latest high. And as the report noted \u201cthe bitcoin dominance has been sitting at its highest levels since November,\u201d and the time for altcoins might be around the corner if optimistic market sentiment continues.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center\"><b><i>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-dominates-altcoins-during-war-torn-month-of-february\/\">Bitcoin Dominates Altcoins During War-Torn Month Of February<\/a><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/small-cap-altcoins-beat-bitcoin-and-other-crypto-assets-10-to-1-but-why\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Small Cap altcoins index has been outperforming the larger coins\u2019.\u00a0 As NewsBTC has been reporting, smaller caps have been looking like the best investment in the past months.
