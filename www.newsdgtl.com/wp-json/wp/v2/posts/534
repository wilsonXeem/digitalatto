While fully-digital garments have been a part of the \u201cmetaverse\u201d for quite some time, the tech to support clothing that can be worn in the \u201creal world\u201d using AR technology was not widely available. But today \u2013\u00a0just a few months later \u2013\u00a0it seems that <\/span><b>AR-enabled digital fashion is at an inflection point.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Very slowly, and then all at once, new tools for creating and monetizing fashion offer the opportunity for creators and designers to build their brands in the metaverse and engage with consumers in entirely new ways. And it\u2019s not just major brands that are joining in the fun \u2013\u00a0supported by platforms that allow anyone to design AR-enabled digital clothing, independent designers are also entering the space at unprecedented speeds.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This influx of new creative channels is great for futuristic fashionistas who want to sport the latest and greatest looks. But it isn\u2019t just about the clothes themselves \u2013 it\u2019s also about the ways that fashion can be manufactured, distributed, and monetized at every level of the industry. Here\u2019s how. But first, a bit of context.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>The Challenges of Traditional Fashion<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically speaking, fashion has always been <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/ch\/en\/pages\/consumer-industrial-products\/articles\/ultimate-challenge-fashion-industry-digital-age.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of the most complex and challenging industries<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to operate in. There are many points of vulnerability on the fashion supply chain. It\u2019s highly affected by global economic uncertainty and industrial developments, as well as fast-paced changes in cultural trends. All of this creates quite a margin of potential risk for manufacturers and retailers \u2013\u00a0not to mention the huge amounts of <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aalto.fi\/en\/news\/the-cost-of-fast-fashion-up-to-92-million-tonnes-of-waste-and-79-trillion-litres-of-water#:~:text=Ukraine%20on%20Aalto-,The%20cost%20of%20'fast%20fashion'%20%E2%80%93%20Up%20to%2092%20million,per%20year%20to%20make%20garments&amp;text=The%20fashion%20industry%20contributes%20to%2010%25%20of%20global%20pollution.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fashion-related waste<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that have resulted from overproduction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR fashion presents designers and manufacturers with a means for brands to sell and market new products that involves less risk. Because AR fashion doesn\u2019t need a manufacturer, it isn\u2019t subject to the same kinds of supply chain risks that traditional fashion is. And because there is no physical product, there is no waste produced.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a win-win, really \u2013 in addition to the lowered risk level, AR fashion has the potential to be a powerful new revenue stream for garment creators of all sizes. This is possible indirectly through AR marketing strategies, like <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">virtual try-on<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">branded AR filters<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But the most direct and powerful way to monetize AR fashion is through blockchain technology \u2013 specifically, through non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>NFTs and AR Fashion\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, combined with blockchain technology, AR fashion brings new revenue streams for both designers of all sizes and stripes. For instance, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Fabricant<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows users to co-create AR fashion pieces with a curated group of invite-only creators, designers, and brands; similarly, <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.thehunt.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hunt<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> curates AR-enabled fashion NFTs from hand-selected independent creators that can be worn and viewed in AR in real time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Designers are the only ones who can benefit from AR-enabled NFTs. Blockchain can also be used to create incentives and rewards for fashion consumers. For instance, the concept of \u201c<\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/wear-to-earn-nfts-target-the-billion-dollar-fashion-industry\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wear to earn<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d could lead brands to reward people for wearing their clothing. Imagine receiving airdrops of tokenized AR fashion pieces to your virtual wallets, or being paid in cryptocurrency when you post a picture of yourself wearing the brand\u2019s clothing on Instagram \u2013 it may happen in the not-so-distant future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And importantly, digital fashion could be a gateway into NFTs and other blockchain-based investments for consumers who would not otherwise venture into the realm of digital assets at all. According to a survey by Vogue Business, buyers of digital fashion include women who <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aren\u2019t necessarily crypto collectors<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR NFTs also have the potential to expand the horizons of the fashion industry in other ways. Specifically, <\/span><b>AR technology opens the doors to consumers who may feel alienated by the traditional fashion industry. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR technology can create fashion experiences for plus-size shoppers, the LGBTQI+ community, and people living with disabilities. Both designers and wearers can use AR fashion to explore new modes of self-expression, unrestrained by traditional limits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Digital fashion isn\u2019t just a novelty anymore \u2013 it\u2019s an emerging industry. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As people\u2019s digital identities become increasingly intersected with their \u201creal world\u201d lives, the ways that people express themselves in digital spaces is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more important<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than ever. There\u2019s huge potential for growth \u2013 and with the advent of NFTs and fungible currencies in the digital fashion world, designers and brands have a vast new toolset to realize their visions \u2013 and earn revenue while they do it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
