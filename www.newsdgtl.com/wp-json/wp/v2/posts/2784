For 24 hours, it seemed as though they were right until the excitement and interest quickly dissipated from all sides.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Traders lost $281 million worth of \u201clongs\u201d to liquidation in the past 24 hours. Overall the total liquidation amount reached <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.coinglass.com\/LiquidationData\">$350 million<\/a>. This is the third-largest level in the month of April. Of that amount, about one-third ($128 million) came from bitcoin-tracked futures. While $92 million arose from ether futures. Futures tracking dogecoin lost $24 million, similar to Tuesday\u2019s loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Doubts On Musk\u2019s Twitter Acquisition<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some Twitter shareholders are concerned that the acquisition may not go through. For instance, their price per share is trading at $49, lower than offered ($54). In addition, the company currently has a market value of about $37 billion \u2013 $6 billion less than when this deal first began.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_489114\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-489114\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-489114 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/DOGEUSD_2022-04-28_02-52-26-860x506.png\" alt=\"DOGE price chart\" width=\"860\" height=\"506\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-489114\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">DOGE is currently trading at $0.138, losing its yesterday gain | Source: BTC\/USD chart from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\">Tradingview.com<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The acquisition of Twitter by Tesla may have unforeseen consequences for the company, particularly its impact on Elon Musk. Many believe he will exit this deal by paying a $1 billion breakup fee.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">China is the biggest market for Tesla, and the company has a large plant over there. So there\u2019s a chance that if Musk tweets something unfavorable about China, the country can punish him. China has strict laws against free speech, and anyone who breaks them risks being penalized by law enforcement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The fear that Musk will not buy Twitter has caused the Dogecoin price to crash. However, it\u2019s believed most investors think if this acquisition closes, it\u2019ll be good news for DOGE because he vows to add them as a payment option.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/institutional-investors-bearish-on-bitcoin-ethereum-heres-what-theyre-buying\/\">Institutional Investors Bearish On Bitcoin, Ethereum. Here\u2019s What They\u2019re Buying<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Dogecoin Price Prediction<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The graph shows that the price of DOGE has been slowly dropping since it hit a high of $0.1725. This is called a double-top pattern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A double-top is usually a sign that the price will go down. The DOGE coin is now close to the 25-day and 50-day moving averages. In addition, the Stochastic Oscillator has moved above the oversold level. It means that the price will probably keep going down. The next key support level is $0.1100. If the price goes above $0.15, this will invalidate the bearish view.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>                Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview.com<\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/dogecoin\/dogecoin-plummets-as-investors-doubts-after-musk-twitter-takeover-unfold\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Investors are raising concerns about Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter.
