The benchmark crypto has been losing bid orders that could absorb future downside price action.<\/p>\n<p>As the chart below shows, BTC had around $10 million in bids orders that were pulled as the crypto trended to the downside. This liquidity seems to have been distributed between $42,000, $41,500, and $41,000 which could stand as the last line of defense against a fresh assault from the bears.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_487824\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-487824\" style=\"width: 848px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-487824 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSD-2-1.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin BTC BTCUSD 2\" width=\"848\" height=\"375\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-487824\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">BTC\u2019s price losses support at around $42,000.

This happened as investors with asks orders of around $100,000 push BTC\u2019s price back down to the low $40,000.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest sellers of this current price action seem to be retail investors and investors with asks orders of around $10,000 (yellow and red in the chart below).

The distribution of liquidity first concentrated at $42,000 and then distributed between those levels and $40,000 seems to support this thesis.<\/p>\n<p>BTC whales often employ this method to trap retail and obtain liquidity to take their positions.
