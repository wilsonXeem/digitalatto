The Zcash <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/z.cash\/\">network<\/a> (ZEC) aims to provide more privacy in transactions as compared to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin<\/a> and similar coins. It was launched in 2016 by a team of independent scientists, Electric Coin Co., and cryptographers. It provides the option to safeguard the information about the sender, receiver, and balance of a transaction to the users with the help of zk-SNARKS, a cryptographic technology.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, Zcash has become one of the most popular privacy coins using <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchain<\/a> technology. There are several contributors from all parts of the world who support the development of the protocol and Zcash ecosystem. Hence it is becoming more strong and more decentralized in the processes of community funding and governance. Using the native token ZEC, Zcash empowers transactions on the whole network.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zcash (ZEC) Fundamental Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zcash is a privacy-preserving <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/top-9-cryptocurrencies-in-2022\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a> that transfers values anonymously and uses zero-knowledge cryptography. The protocol gives the options of shielded, transparent, and anonymous transactions to be there on the Zcash blockchain. The blockchain pays some portion of its block reward as the \u201cFounder\u2019s Reward\u201d for funding the protocol development. The Founder\u2019s Reward is currently allocated to the Electric Coin Company and the Zcash Foundation to develop the Zcash protocol, respectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most prestigious technical teams in the world launched Zcash, and many independent organizations get funded to novelize it. They have made it the first practical implementation of zk-SNARKS in a new form of zero-knowledge cryptography. It gives protection to the freedom of spending and saving money with the strongest privacy than any other digital currency. So, it is also called \u2018HTTPS of blockchains\u2019. It is now available for trade on top-known exchanges, digital <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-wallet-definition\/\">wallets<\/a>, and a high number of applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the growth of the ecosystem and the entrance of more funds, Zcash continues to become more decentralized, with a much more diverse community and stronger technology. A Zcash development fund issues a total of 20% mining rewards to three organizations, while the other 80% gets allocated to miners. Community platforms, Zcash development funds, and initiatives collectively provide an incentive to the team and developers to increase their efficiency, fix bugs, provide a better user experience, build out applications, and pitch ideas.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Zcash works<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two types of transaction addresses in ZCash that are z and t addresses. The t-address are the transparent transactions that cause de-shield transactions, while the z-address represents private transactions that make shielded transactions between two users. You can get the ZEC token and trade it with other digital currencies using exchanges or brokers and then spend them or save them using only a mobile phone or a desktop and a digital wallet. In any social class, if you have an internet connection, you will have access to use Zcash as anyone else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Zcash, users have full control over sharing transaction\u2019s view keys; as compared to other public ledgers, as in other public ledgers, only the people with the correct keys can see the contents of a transaction. Here, transactions are independent of the cooperation from the other parties. Researchers from various worldwide universities contributed to input in the diligent science used in Zcash. Hence, they implemented the zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge, briefly known as zk- SNARKs. This makes the cheap fees possible for private digital money.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokenomics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ZEC is the native currency of the Zcash network. The total <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-circulating-supply-and-maximum-supply\/\">supply<\/a> is twenty million Zcash coins and is often referred to as lowercase zcash. The transactions of Zcash are both transparent and shielded. Transparent transactions are the ones that are the same as Bitcoin. The addresses and transaction amounts are visible in them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, in shielded transactions, addresses and transaction amounts are hidden for operating. Anyone who is using shielded transactions has the ability to disclose transaction metadata selectively for auditing and regulatory purposes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zcash mining rewards are divided between the miners and the stakeholders, including Zcash Foundation and a few of its employees. Miners get 80 percent of the reward, while the remaining stakeholders share the remaining 20 percent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zcash blockchain has been designed after Bitcoin. A similar halving procedure was adopted where rewards are halved at set intervals. In this case, the intervals would be four years apart. The next halving is approaching fast. Expected to approach in November 2022, the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin-halving\/\">halving<\/a> would cut the block mining rewards down to 3.125 ZEC, half of the current reward.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zcash Future Plans\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They have not announced a future roadmap but have completed their commitments and plans made in the past, showing their dedication to achievements and accomplishments. Researchers of Johns Hopkins University wrote the paper \u201cZerocoin: Anonymous Distributed E-Cash from Bitcoin\u201d to introduce the way to use zk-SNARKS to add privacy to Bitcoin in 2013. It was difficult to add such a complex privacy scheme to Bitcoin, so they decided to launch a new coin with this technology implemented onto it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A computer scientist Zooko Wilcox-O\u2019Hearn started it using the Electric Coin method. The developers decided to use a \u2018trust setup\u2019 or a \u2018ceremony\u2019 to use zk-SNARKS to create Zcash as it needs the developers to never leak secret data in any situation during the setup process. In 2017, Zcash improved the process by launching a second trusted setup. The improved zk-SNARKS technology facilitated more developers\u2019 involvement. It also lowered the chances of failure of the trust set up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zcash also implemented the Sapling hard fork upgrade in 2018 to improve the activity and confidentiality of the cryptocurrency\u2019s shielded transactions. In 2021, ECC announced the plans to shift Zcash away from its <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-proof-of-work\/\">proof-of-work<\/a> consensus mechanism with a more interoperable and energy-efficient staking system. Zcash also decided to eliminate the trusted setup to add future upgrades.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Zcash team had also worked to make easier use of shielded transactions. As the transactions had become more guzzled up using higher than normal computational power and non-private transactions. For the future, Zcash has launched Halo and Halo 2 developments to offer the best opportunities for the privacy of this coin and resolve some of its most highlighted problems. Zcash is in conversation with the top privacy coins and will continue to walk ahead to gain privacy for itself and become top listed in this race.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zcash (ZEC) Price Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Zcash price is $85, with a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\">market capitalization<\/a> of $1.2 billion.
