The price was around $1 in the last week of December. Then, it had a bearish breakout of around 45%, where the price declined to around $0.55. Nonetheless, XRP found crucial support in that region, which then led to a price recovery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the next couple of weeks, XRP reached as high as $0.91, after an increase of more than 65%. After hitting resistance, the price retraced to around $0.62. Then, XRP had yet another go upward, but it faced resistance once again close to the $0.90 region.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More recently, XRP retraced to $0.68 after finding support from the lower trend line in the shorter run. While XRP is currently trading above $0.75, the overall trend continues to be bearish, and the price may keep declining in the coming days, other things equal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fear and greed indicators suggest that there is overall fear throughout the market and not just for XRP traders. Moreover, looking at the Bollinger bands in the 1-day chart, we could see slightly less volatility compared to a couple of weeks back. Still, the price is moving within the bands, meaning that there are no indications for a trend reversal in the short run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On another note, the recent price movement of XRP in the daily chart shows a narrowing wedge pattern. This pattern usually indicates that there may be a breakout in the coming days as the wedge gets narrower.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24877\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24877\" style=\"width: 2474px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24877\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"XRP Price Analysis April\" width=\"800\" height=\"404\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/month-1.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24877\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/month-1.png\" alt=\"XRP Price Analysis April\" width=\"800\" height=\"404\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24877\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">XRP\/USDT 1-Day Chart.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key Structures<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Support<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resistance<\/span><\/h3>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indicators<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving Average<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both the 20-MA and the 50-MA lines of a 1-day chart are currently acting as resistance to the price of XRP.

After failing to break resistance at $0.90, the price found support again at that same level. This indicates that the overall buying pressure has increased in the last few weeks.

Since indicators strongly suggest that there is plenty of space for XRP to increase, and since the recent candlestick pattern shows possible signs of a breakout, we may see XRP increase in the coming weeks. If XRP manages to break our projected resistance level, then we may see XRP aim for $1.30 in the coming weeks, other things equal. Of course, the price of XRP also depends largely on the price movement of BTC. If the latter also increases, there\u2019s no reason to doubt XRP\u2019s potential for the short run.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Latest News for XRP \u2013 Affecting Price<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recent updates regarding XRP and the SEC lawsuit show that SEC has finally ended its discovery phase. This recent announcement came as a shock to many, including the likes of Jeremy Hogan, the attorney who is in charge of analyzing SEC lawsuits.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Almost NOTHING would have surprised me more than this.<\/p>\n<p>And yes, this is a very good thing.

He argued that while XRP may have the upper hand in some areas, there is still work to be done. He argues that SEC and XRP should reach common ground soon rather than let it be decided by the jury of the court. Despite the obvious losses that XRP can have, Deaton suggests that SEC could face problems as well, primarily because of the dispute regarding fair notice.
