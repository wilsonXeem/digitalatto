With CEO Derek Yoo, Moonbeam\u2019s co-founder and commander-in-chief from Purestake, and COO Stefan Melhorn, the Moonbeam Flight Crew founded Moonbeam in January.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moonbeam smart contracts are created by the company <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.purestake.com\/\">Pure Stake<\/a>, which also provides protocol implementation services and produces tools for blockchain networks. Moonbeam is a for-profit company based in Boston, Massachusetts. In August 2020, the Web 3.0 foundation awarded Pure stake a grant for their efforts in building Ethereum interoperability on the Moonbeam network.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is Moonbeam (GLMR)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In order to aid in the creation of a web 3.0 remote procedure call (RPC), which enables developers to run Ethereum applications on a Moonbeam network, Pure stake was awarded the funds by the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum <\/a>Foundation. In September 2020, the business announced the completion of a $1.4 million fund for Moonbeam. This was headed by heavyweight venture capital firm Hypersphere Ventures and included a number of other well-known organizations as participants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Afterward, the monies were utilized to aid employees on the Moonbeam network in their efforts to speed up the process and create a polka dot-based smart contract platform that was Ethereum-compatible. Later, in late March 2021, Purestake announced the successful conclusion of a six million dollar strategic fundraising round, which was headed by <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.coinfund.io\/\">CoinFund<\/a> and featured Binance Labs as a participant.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moonbeam\u2019s Journey in the Polkadot Network<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A grant from the<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-web3\/\"> Web 3<\/a> Foundation, as well as a vote of confidence, have enabled Moonbeam to complete its seed and critical rounds of funding. The platform remained largely obscure till November 2021, when it was granted Polkadot para-chain status, indicating that it has a promising future. And over 200,000 Moonbeam fans collectively contributed almost a billion US dollars in dots to help the company attain the desired power chain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A short time later on, the Moonbeam team started the process of transitioning the platform to the Polkadot network. On January 11th of this year, the Moonbeam platform became operational on the Polkadot network. With the addition of<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/smart-contracts\/\"> smart contracts<\/a>, Moonbeam has evolved into a para-chain that interacts with and supports Ethereum virtual machines based on the Polkadot pattern.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is the Polkadot Network, And How Does it Work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Polkadot has been referred to as the \u201cblockchain of blockchains\u201d in certain sectors. It was founded by Gavin Wood, a co-founder, and developer of the Ethereum cryptocurrency. The platform\u2019s core principle is that no one blockchain is suitable for every use case, and as a result, the web needs an inner lining that links several chains. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/polkadot-price-prediction-2022\/\">Polkadot<\/a> is the essential layer-0 foundation that powers a vast network of layer-1 blockchain networks known as parachains. Polka Dot is the basis for the Polka Dot network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moonbeam is one of the parachains that runs in parallel with the core relay chain and links to it as well as the other parachains. It is connected to the core relay chain and the other parachains. The polka dot provides standardized security and cross-chain compatibility functions, but each para-chain maintains ownership and independence over its own network, despite the fact that they share the polka dot\u2019s benefits. A stumbling barrier between where we are now and where we want to be in the future is the lack of cross-chain interoperability, which is characterized by a free web built on autonomous blockchain-based systems rather than owned and controlled, centrally controlled networks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What Services Does Moonbeam Provide?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moonbeam provides a number of valuable tools, services, and activities that most of its rivals do not, enabling it to meet its multi-chain objectives. It contains the following features:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A big, growing ecosystem<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">APIs for the Web 3.0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A compatibility environment for substrates<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Connections that are cross-chain compatible<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Unique Smart Contract technology<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moonbeam has so far incorporated a variety of online services, connections, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/dapp-meaning-what-are-dapps\/\">DApps<\/a>, miners, storage providers, and web 3.0 wallets, all of which can connect to Moonbeam\u2019s multiple ecosystems, including Polkadot and Ethereum.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moonbeam (GLMR) Price Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When it comes to investing in Bitcoin, understanding the circulating supply and market capitalization are critical. So, how do you calculate<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\"> market capitalization<\/a>? Multiply your circulating supply by your pricing to get your market cap. Moonbeam has a market value of $325.28 million with 272 million coins in circulation and a price of $1.20. In all, $325 million are currently invested in Moonbeam throughout all exchange ecosystems across the globe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bitcoin, for example, reached a peak of $68,500. A total of 1.3 trillion dollars was invested in the market of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin<\/a> at the time. For the price of Moonbeam to reach five dollars, the market cap must be 950 million dollars; for it to reach a price of $20, the market cap must be $4 billion. To reach a price of $250, a market capitalization of $47 billion would be necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crypto Academy Moonbeam (GLMR) Price Prediction<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Following extensive research, we at the<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/category\/price-prediction\/\"><strong> Crypto Academy<\/strong><\/a> have come up with a Moonbeam price forecast. However, though, we highly suggest you do your own research before investing in any project since this is not financial advice in any form whatsoever.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moonbeam (GLMR) Price Prediction 2022<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So, as we speak, the price of Moonbeam is rapidly rising. With a price of $1.20 and a circulating supply of 272 million, and a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-circulating-supply-and-maximum-supply\/\">maximum supply<\/a> of 1.01 billion, Moonbeam (GLMR) is presently ranked #107 regarding market cap. We believe that Moonbeam is likely to end the year 2022 with a possible price between $2.80-$3.10.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moonbeam (GLMR) Price Prediction 2023<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We anticipate that by 2023, Moonbeam will have reached a peak price of $3.80. But given the current events around the globe, every industry will bear a severe toll in the years ahead. That being said, we predicted that the price might go as low as $2.90. Of course, this might change if the market gets bullish. Although another bull run is less likely to happen in 2023, the crypto market is <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-volatility\/\">volatile<\/a> and unexpected.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moonbeam (GLMR) Price Prediction 2024<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The year 2024, on the other hand, will be a completely different story. The Bitcoin halving will take place in 2024. As a consequence, Moonbeam, as well as the whole crypto market, is likely to flourish. According to our forecast, the lowest price Moonbeam will achieve this year is $5.00, with the greatest price reaching $6.90. Our prediction shows Moonbeam ending the year 2024 with a possible <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/investing-vs-trading-crypto\/\">trading<\/a> value of around $6.35.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moonbeam (GLMR) Price Prediction 2025<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In 2025, the whole market, including Moonbeam, is most likely to become bullish. This might lead to Moonbeam achieving high values as a result of the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin-halving\/\">Bitcoin halving<\/a> and the increasing adoption of blockchain technology. The market cap of Moonbeam is expected to reach a value of $3 billion by 2025. Moonbeam is expected to attain the lowest price of $8.20 this year, with a 2025 yearly high of $9.10.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moonbeam (GLMR) Price Prediction 2026<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As for 2026, we believe that <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrencies<\/a> and blockchain technology will have reached a higher level of adoption. This might lead to less volatility and more stability. As a result, Moonbeam could end the year 2026 with a price of +-10% of the price it had at the beginning of the year, leaving at a price of $10.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_26329\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26329\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-26329\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Moonbeam Price Forecast Chart\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-563.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-26329\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-563.png\" alt=\"Moonbeam Price Forecast Chart\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-26329\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Crypto Academy Moonbeam (GLMR) Price Prediction for 2022-2026.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Where to Buy Moonbeam?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you\u2019re looking for a place to purchase Moonbeam, the best <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-exchange\/\">cryptocurrency exchanges<\/a> to use right now are Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, Huobi Global, and ByBit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Is Moonbeam (GLMR) a Scam?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You may feel confident that Moonbeam is safe and is not a scam whatsoever.
