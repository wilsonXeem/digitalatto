With the important quarterly candle set to close tonight, let\u2019s look at what technicals might say about the direction of the next quarter.<\/p>\n<h2>Q1 2022 Comes To A Close For Bitcoin<\/h2>\n<p>The first quarter of a year, often sets the tone for the year to come. In investments, a poor Q1 performance is indicative of a bad year ahead.

Such a long wick suggests that before the quarter came to a close, buyers stepped up in a major way. Buyers were able to step up in a larger capacity in Q1 2022 than bears were able to in the final quarter of last year. The bearish wick to close 2021 only just made it over 30% by comparison.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-487342 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/BTCUSD_2022-03-31_13-04-56-860x411.png\" alt=\"BTCUSD_2022-03-31_13-04-56\" width=\"860\" height=\"411\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">The quarterly RSI bounced off the moving average | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/BTCUSD\/\">BTCUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p>By those standards, bulls might still have the upper hand.
