Except for one, which is to end deforestation by 2030.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nature-based solutions, particularly forests, have a vital role to play in mitigating the worst effects of climate change. And now, with a set date to aim for, pressure is mounting from governments and the public to rapidly roll out a global programme of well-executed nature-based solutions (NbS) to sequester several gigatons of carbon each year and protect biodiversity. However, current NbS projects are hampered by chronic underfunding. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As these deep challenges about how to fund and verify progress towards this goal are contemplated, blockchain could once again be the answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>A new <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/4c.cst.cam.ac.uk\/\">Cambridge centre<\/a> to build a decentralized marketplace for carbon credits and support global reforestation efforts, could be the progress the natural world needs. The centre will bring together computer scientists and conservation scientists to get the job done.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ssrcss-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i85\" data-component=\"text-block\">\n<div class=\"ssrcss-18snukc-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi1\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Built on the energy-efficient self-upgradable Proof of Stake blockchain <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/tezos.com\/\">Tezos<\/a>, The centre will use a combination of AI and satellite sensing to build a decentralised marketplace of verifiable carbon credits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, and the Conservation Research Institute \u2013 the centre has two primary goals: to support students and researchers in the relevant areas of computer science, environmental science, and economics; and to create a decentralised marketplace where purchasers of carbon credits can confidently and directly fund trusted nature-based projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Centre will build its decentralised marketplace on the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tezos<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> blockchain because it operates sustainably, in line with the Centre\u2019s vision to support a sustainable future through technology. The goal of the marketplace is to exponentially increase the number of real nature-based conservation and restoration projects by channelling funding towards them via market-based instruments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCurrent accreditation systems that measure and report the value of carbon and related benefits like biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction rendered by NbS are costly, slow and inaccurate,\u201d said Centre Director Dr Anil Madhavapeddy. \u201cThese systems have undermined trust in NbS carbon credits. What is needed is a decentralised marketplace where purchasers of carbon credits can confidently and directly fund trusted nature-based projects. And that\u2019s the gap the Centre is aiming to fill.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrew Balmford, Professor of Zoology, said: \u201cThe recent announcement at COP26 of the new commitment to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 demonstrates the crucial role forests play in carbon capture and the health of our planet. The new Centre has a significant role to play in supporting crucial research to develop new, trusted mechanisms to support reforestation projects.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Centre will support 12 PhD students and postdoctoral fellows, and investment to prototype a scalable, trusted NbS marketplace. Researchers funded from the Centre will come from the Departments of Computer Science and Technology, Zoology, and Plant Sciences, as well as from the Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence for the study of Environment Risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p><script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n!function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s){if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?\nn.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;\nn.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;\nt.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window,\ndocument,'script','https:\/\/connect.facebook.net\/en_US\/fbevents.js');\n<\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.the-blockchain.com\/2021\/11\/17\/new-cambridge-built-decentralized-carbon-credit-marketplace-will-support-reforestation-to-meet-glasgow-climate-goal\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Now that the climate top in Glasgow has been wrapped up, and world leaders all flew home to their respective countries, we are kind of left with a slightly bitter taste in our mouths.
