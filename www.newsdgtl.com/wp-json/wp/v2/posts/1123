He went on to say that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cthey think that all the transactions that run for crypto are all done by criminals. It\u2019s all money laundering.

With Hansen as the leader, a campaign was launched to influence the vote of the economic committee against MiCA regulations. The <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/users-should-be-wary-of-crypto-assets-eu\/\">Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA)<\/a>, is the key legislation package of the European Union for crypto-asset oversight.
