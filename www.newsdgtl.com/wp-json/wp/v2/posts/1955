It consists of fives stages, in chronological\/completion order from left to right; they are the merge, the surge, the verge, the purge, and the splurge.<\/p>\n<p>With the merge being the first of five stages, the ConsenSys layer has a long way to go before completion.<\/p>\n<p>Pre-new path, the previous first stage \u2014 called Phase 0 \u2014 was rolling out the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/upgrades\/beacon-chain\/\">Beacon Chain<\/a>, which was beset with delays and eventually shipped in December 2020.
