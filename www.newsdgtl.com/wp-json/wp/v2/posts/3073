Using incentives, Retoken will attract sellers and consumers working in the market to promote your products and services.<\/p>\n<p>CEO of Retoken, Sanan Hasanov, said:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cIn order to bring measured results to these person-to-person recommendations, we decided to create Retoken. Retoken is a referral bonus system that motivates customers to recommend the products and services they use in their daily life and to get Retoken bonuses for that. This model is not new but by applying blockchain technology, we\u2019ve made it automated, measurable, transparent, and with a limited number of Retokens, we made it profitable.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>How the Referral System Works<\/h4>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.retoken.io\">Retoken<\/a> eliminates the uncertainty associated with unsynchronized bonus incentives through an automated decentralized platform that connects manufacturers and producers with buyers and consumers. Using the Retoken console, manufacturers can implement global, national, or local bonus programs. These can be linked with real business cases, systemizing the process. Buyers and sellers can participate in these bonus programs seamlessly and enjoy the benefits being pushed forth.<\/p>\n<p>As customers share feedback on the products they enjoy using the platform, producers can obtain real-time data on the number of products being sold by the number of incentive points contributed to each seller. Buyers who obtain loyalty tokens can also provide rich insights into user preferences as Retoken cultivates positive reinforcements to reward participants for reviewing their preferred products positively.<\/p>\n<p>Because of the use of blockchain technology, transactions are immutable and transparent. They also guarantee secure participation and the safety of data. Companies and producers will also benefit from Retoken\u2019s global network. Also, they can form beneficial partnerships that\u2019ll enable the companies to grow vertically. Invariably, this secures access to a new market while providing new business development opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Retoken plans to be a global force operating from at least ten countries and serving over 1000 companies by 2025. To achieve this, it plans to form a transparent mechanism for referral bonuses while providing a simple and understandable service model. The company is also developing highly reliable mobile solutions while generating growing value for its token, Retoken (RETO).<\/p>\n<p>One of the colourful event happening soon is that Retoken is getting listed on MacaronSwap, 11th May 2022 and the token will be traded on both CEX and DEX. Get in early!<\/p>\n<h4>About RETO<\/h4>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bscscan.com\/token\/0x331d7778Ac4f9e33bf236cDCD0F9b2B3F7C461BB\">RETO is a BEP-20 token<\/a> built on the Binance Smart Chain. The token standard ensures quick transactions, interchain compatibility, attracts low fees, and makes it easy to list the token on decentralized exchanges. It can also be used on the Ethereum network and stored on the Retoken wallet or on any third-party wallet supporting Binance Smart Chain.<\/p>\n<p>According to the whitepaper, RETO will have a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens. The limited supply will help the token value to grow in the future as demand for the token increases. Token allocation will be spread across technical development, business development, marketing and PR, finance and legal.<\/p>\n<p>Of these, 55% will be allocated to investors and the community, while the core team and advisors will get 20%. 10% will go to the Foundation, 5% to contractors and contingency reserves and 5% to the DEX liquidity pools. There may be plans for a staking pool in the future as 4% of the tokens have been allocated for staking. The remaining 1% is for security and bounty rewards.<\/p>\n<p>As it is a global project, RETO will soon be available on centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Listing on these exchanges will make it possible to exchange the fiat of the respective countries directly with the token.<\/p>\n<p>The founder of \u00d6zbah\u00e7eci group, Turan \u00d6zbah\u00e7eci, noted:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cA very high probability that the token will go up and become more profitable because of the limited supply of the token.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/company\/retoken-announces-plans-to-revolutionize-business-referral-systems\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Retoken has unveiled its plans to revolutionize how businesses and individuals benefit from the manufacturer-buyer process.
