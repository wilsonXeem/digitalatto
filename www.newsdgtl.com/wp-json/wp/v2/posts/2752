With regards to their aesthetic, each NFT sports a funky and vibrant PFP style, which, in isolation, provides a whole host of artistic utility.<\/p>\n<p>Cosmetic appearance is by no means the staple piece of the NFT\u2019s value, as with <strong>16 P2E titles<\/strong> already launched on the platform (with many more to be added in the coming months), a Genesis Gamer NFT offers holders the chance to enjoy a diverse portfolio of games whilst simultaneously earning $TIC (one of the platform\u2019s two native tokens).<\/p>\n<p>The utility doesn\u2019t stop there, as after earning $TIC through Genesis Gamer NFT ownership and further gameplay, users will be able to leverage such tokens to summon new NFTs, buy ad-free subscriptions, or sell for crypto.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Whitelist<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>The first two sales of Genesis Gamer NFTs sold out in rapid succession, meaning a whitelist spot for the third and final drop is vital for anyone wanting to join <strong>Infinite Arcade\u2019s cutting-edge ecosystem<\/strong>. In joining the whitelist, you will not only be securing yourself pre-sale access to the launch of the remaining 6,666 Genesis Gamer NFTs on May 10th, but you will also be giving yourself a chance to win one.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In joining the whitelist you will also receive Infinite Arcade news, offers, and exclusive experiences.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Other Functions<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Individual gamers are not the only parties to benefit from Infinite Arcade\u2019s services, as the platform is embedded with a powerful tool which helps gaming guilds build and manage their P2E empires with ease.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the platform\u2019s software development toolkit (SDK) also makes it straightforward for developers to onboard their games into the metaverse, giving every studio and <strong>game creator<\/strong> the opportunity to attract new players, increase engagement and drive more revenue. Here, P2E mechanics can be easily added to the games without compromise, whilst also providing the option for players to choose whether to engage with it or not. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Roadmap<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/b><\/h4>\n<p>As we dive deeper into Q2 2022, the platform will be launching pre-sales for its $ARC token (its second native token), add new gameplays (such as tournaments, battles, races etc.), add new NFT collections (including earnable NFTs), issue payouts to guilds and managers, host 50 live games, and produce public facing reports.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Q3 will see the public launch and staking of $ARC, a third<strong> Infinite Arcade NFT collection<\/strong>, cosmetic NFTs, upgrades and other features given to NFT holders, and the hosting of 100 live games.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>By the end of the calendar year, Infinite Arcade will host a Land offering, launch a marketplace for third-party NFT collections, and host 200 live games.<\/p>\n<h4><b>The Team<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>The Infinite Arcade team is made up of a multicultural group of <strong>doxxed contributors<\/strong> who come with backgrounds in art, design, community management, product development, strategy, tech, and developer partnerships.
