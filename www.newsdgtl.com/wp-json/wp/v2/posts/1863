Because the pros so heavily outweigh the cons in this situation, we are instead in this review hoping to determine if PrimeXBT is the professional platform it claims to be or if it is another con artist crypto trading venue worth passing by.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">About PrimeXBT: Pros Versus Cons<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Launched in 2018, PrimeXBT is an award-winning multi-asset margin trading platform offering lightning-quick order execution with no slippage and ultra-fast reliable performance with as much as 99.9% uptime. More than 100 of today\u2019s most popular trading instruments are included across crypto, forex, commodities, and stock indices.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Pro: Flexible Currency Options<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PrimeXBT being a multi-asset margin trading platform, lets users deposit a wide range of crypto assets: BTC (Bitcoin), ETH (Ethereum), USDT (ERC-20 Tether), USDC (USD Coin), and the COV (Covesting) utility token.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Pro: Buy Crypto Here<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Don\u2019t have crypto yet? Don\u2019t sweat it. PrimeXBT lets you <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/primexbt.com\/buy-crypto?utm_source=PR&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=PrimeXBT+Review+2022%3A+Pros+And+Cons+For+Crypto+Traders\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">buy crypto<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> assets with a credit card from several third-party partner widgets, each with competitive conversion rates and limited fees. Users can also exchange one type of cryptocurrency for another within each wallet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Pro: No Minimum Deposit<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Deposits are made to a secure cryptocurrency wallet protected by two-factor authentication and compulsory address whitelisting. There is no minimum deposit to get started, so anyone with any level of capital can begin. This also lets new users test the waters without putting too much money at risk on a new platform.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Con: Up To 24-Hour Withdrawals<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To avoid any confusion and to be clear about any potential cons at the platform, one pitfall for impatient users is the fact that withdrawals can take up to 24 hours to send. If you need your crypto urgently, you will simply have to wait as there is no way around this security protocol.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Pro: Virtually Hack-Proof<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The con above is a worthy trade-off for a platform that hasn\u2019t once in its nearly five-year history been hacked or had any significant downtime. No users have reported any consequential loss of funds due to theft. This spotless reputation is rare in today\u2019s crypto industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Pro: Versatile Account System<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With safety in check and deposits made, by now, it is time to start funding individual accounts within the PrimeXBT dashboard. In addition to margin trading accounts that are anything but standard, there are also APY-generating yield accounts, Covesting accounts, and more. All of this is available within one primary account and under just one roof.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Pro: Crypto, Forex, Commodities, &amp; Stock Indices<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Margin trading and Covesting strategy managers have access to more than 100 of today\u2019s most volatile and popular trading instruments, including Bitcoin, gold, oil, the S&amp;P 500, and much more.

Dirk Hartig has prepared an extensive database of trading tips, tutorials, and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Pro: Compete For Crypto\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With these new skills gained, you can both practice with risk-free virtual funds or put them to the ultimate test within PrimeXBT contests and compete for massive crypto prizes worth up to $100,000 USDT. New competitions go live weekly, and trading is conducted in a simulated real-time market environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Pro: Copy Trading Community<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You either have what it takes, or you don\u2019t. If you do, you might want to give a shot at becoming a Covesting strategy manager. These strategy manager accounts are ranked by performance in a fully transparent global leaderboard for followers to pick and choose which traders they should follow. For those that don\u2019t have what it takes, using Covesting, you can still follow someone who does, copy their trades, and profit from market volatility.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Pro: Utility Token Utilization<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With Covesting a centerpiece of PrimeXBT\u2019s offering, the platform has fully integrated the native utility token to the Covesting ecosystem, COV. This token activates exclusive memberships that each improve the benefits for users. Activated utilities include trading fee discounts, increased following counts, improved APYs, and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Pro: High Yield APYs<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">During the DeFi explosion, PrimeXBT rolled out a yield generating tool of their own that connected to top decentralized protocols to access a variable APY return on any staked crypto assets in just a few clicks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Pro: Free Mobile Apps<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All of these products and services are available no matter where you are, right from the tips of your fingers, thanks to entirely free iOS and Android smartphone applications.
