Say hello to the epic visionary artist <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Hypnagogist\">Hypnagogist<\/a>, who is a master of mixed media and psychedelic art.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive in and find out more about his incredible journey in NFT art!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How did you find out about the NFT space, and what attracted you to create your own NFTs?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I found the NFT space primarily through being involved with the 3DINTERNET Discord server started by Nicole Ruggiero, which has a ton of amazing artists and generally awesome people! Essentially, most of my digital and 3D work up until that point was just done for personal projects and wasn\u2019t something I considered sustaining myself with, but the NFT space, after a lot of mixed success initially, has allowed me to do that! Over the past year, I\u2019ve been able to build up connections in some really great communities.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How often do you create?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Pretty much nonstop, honestly! It\u2019s honestly my purpose in life, and I\u2019m always exploring mediums, techniques, and processes and integrating them into my own process. I\u2019m an experimenter at heart, and I\u2019m constantly trying new ways to change things up and really enhance my work.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38509 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/hypna2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"633\" height=\"888\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What is your creative process?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I don\u2019t really lay claim to one specific creative process. I think what I\u2019d largely say is the key component of my process is experimentation, as I mentioned before. I work in traditional and digital pieces, from acrylic painting to 3D modeling, and I feel that each medium informs my work in a different way and allows me to carry what I\u2019ve learned between them.<\/p>\n<p>Probably the best example of this is the series of projection mapped paintings that I\u2019ve been creating, which combine traditional painting, 3D modeling in Blender, projection mapping in Touchdesigner, and really represents the unification of all of my different methods of work!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38510 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/hypna3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"526\" height=\"822\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Are there any CryptoArtists you would love to collaborate with?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There are too many to count, the visionary art scene is full of amazing artists that I\u2019d love to collaborate with one day, with just a few of my favorites being Glass Crane, Ben Ridgeway, Burt Veracruz, Eloh, Kyle Dineen, and I could really go on! I have a couple of collaborations planned for the near future, but I have to get through a bunch of work before I can finally start them!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38515 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/hypna8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"608\" height=\"897\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What do you think the future of CryptoArt will look like?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Ideally, an emphasis on sustainable networks like Algorand will get a big push in CryptoArt. I would also personally like to see a much greater focus placed on 1\/1 fine art type projects rather than collectables, which may be a bit of a biased opinion, but there are so many artists in the scene doing incredibly cool stuff and I want to see more of them get recognized!<\/p>\n<p>I maintain a lot of healthy skepticism around a lot of web3.0 projects, but there are some things that have a ton of potential, so I\u2019m just keeping my eye on a myriad of different things and seeing what\u2019s going to work in the end.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38512 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/hypna5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"631\" height=\"878\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What are you currently working on?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>My primary projects aren\u2019t actually NFT-related at the moment, my main one being a huge art installation, essentially. It\u2019s been a ridiculous amount of work, but the payoff is going to be amazing. I\u2019ll be back to working on NFT projects before long, I have some big personal pieces planned, there just so much time in the day and I\u2019m being pushed to my limit as it is, but they\u2019re going to be a big level up on my previous 3D work.<\/p>\n<p>I also plan on working on more hybrid traditional-digital projection mapped pieces over the course of the year, so that\u2019s something to look forward to!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38511 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/hypna4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"627\" height=\"878\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Where can collectors find your work?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You can find me just about anywhere under the handle Hypnagogist! Right now, I\u2019m primarily found on Ethereum and Algorand-based markets, but I\u2019m also starting to experiment with a market on Kusama called <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/Singular.app\">Singular<\/a> that I\u2019m excited to be a part of!<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/psynft.xyz\">PsyNFT<\/a>\u00a0 (by NFTrippy) is a fantastic showcase of visionary artists and colleagues where you can find my work and some of the best artists working in the scene!
