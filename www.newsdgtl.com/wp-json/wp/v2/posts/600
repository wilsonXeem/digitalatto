Offering a massive leap forward in NFT scaling and performance, Efinity is currently capable of minting 2,000+ NFTs to 2,000+ separate wallets per transaction with transaction fees 2,000x lower than existing NFTs on Ethereum.<\/p>\n<p>Virtual wallets enable easy onboarding by not requiring new users to have a crypto wallet, and cross-chain bridges will enable users to port their NFTs and cryptocurrencies onto Efinity from any blockchain. Additionally, developers will be able to subsidize transaction costs for their users using Efinity\u2019s fuel tanks.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u201cAfter four years of intensive research and development, Efinity adopters now have access to the most scalable, secure, and feature-packed NFT blockchain available.
