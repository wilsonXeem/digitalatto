At the same time, Greenlight will integrate with the Breez LSP, providing its users with advanced liquidity and connectivity services.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u201cFor the past three years we\u2019ve been using the Breez mobile app as a playground to see how people can interact with the Lightning economy. We launched several new services like our point-of-sale and podcast player to become a sort of Lightning swiss army knife. Greenlight allows us to take the next evolutionary step in our quest to build a sovereign and scalable Lightning platform.\u201d<\/strong><br \/><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/breez.technology\/\"><strong>\u2013 Roy Sheinfeld, Breez CEO<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Greenlight is powered by the modular and extensible open-source implementation, Core Lightning\u2026<\/strong><br \/>Its low resource footprint is one of the many advantages that allow Blockstream to provision nodes more efficiently and cost-effectively than other providers on the market.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Some of Greenlight\u2019s other benefits include:<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Secured<\/strong>: Greenlight is 100% non-custodial. While the nodes run on Blockstream infrastructure, the operations team never has access to user funds, and transactions are always verified on a user\u2019s device before signing off on them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Low-Cost<\/strong>: The leanness of Core Lightning and Greenlight\u2019s ability to stay offline when not in use keep users from incurring unneeded costs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>One-User, One-Node<\/strong>: Unlike bundling a node with a front-end app, Greenlight allows users to share a single node among many front-ends, saving on on-chain fees and improving fund control.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Easy Recovery<\/strong>: When a user loses a phone, it will not mean losing bitcoin. Since Blockstream manages databases and backups, recovering funds is as simple as initiating a new front-end with a seed phrase.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<aside class=\"mashsb-container mashsb-main mashsb-stretched\">\n                <\/aside>\n<p>            <!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.8.1-->\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/p><\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptoninjas.net\/2022\/04\/05\/lightning-platform-breez-integrates-blockstreams-greenlight-node-service\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Blockstream, a bitcoin &amp; crypto-financial infrastructure provider, today announced a new collaboration with Breez, a popular Lightning platform, who will integrate its on-demand node service, Greenlight.
