As a result, losing around 0.6 ETH ($1700) in funds, but coming away a little more cautious and a degree wiser following the incident.<\/p>\n<p>In what comes as a genuinely smart move, Jennie decided to<strong> follow the transactions of NFT influencers<\/strong> instead of listening to their silken words. To do this, she set up an alert system on icy.tool which would notify her of any activity.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">How I got scammed \ud83d\ude2d <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/nftinvest?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#nftinvest<\/a> I wasn\u2019t sure if I should post this, because I was so stupid and I am so angry with myself rn. But again, I want to let more people know what happened so you won\u2019t make the same mistake. Let\u2019s begin\u2026 <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/9a1TkgH25M\">pic.twitter.com\/9a1TkgH25M<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Jennie (@JennieCuteCat) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JennieCuteCat\/status\/1519256321308078080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 27, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>As a result, an alert triggered from someone on her list of respected collectors, and Jennie jumped in to investigate. What she found was an apparent \u2018stealth drop\u2019 for a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LouisVuitton\">Louis Vuitton<\/a> collection with a massive 26 ETH floor. Following a mint link, she located the drop, meeting with an availability tracker quickly counting down to zero. So, letting the <strong>FOMO get the better of her<\/strong>, Jennie then snapped up 5 NFTs for 0.12 apiece.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly afterwards, the dread set in. The transactions didn\u2019t show up on OpenSea, and the NFTs notable for their absence. She was the victim of an extravagant ploy, hooked by those exploiting members who read between the transactions. Thankfully, Jennie conducted herself through a designated hot wallet, and the damage limited to what she had spent. Others however, were not so lucky.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
