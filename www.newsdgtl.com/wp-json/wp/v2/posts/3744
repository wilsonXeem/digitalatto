So, each of the prominent buyers got all of the available ones for particular teams.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The BIG3 league\u2019s season five starts on June 18th, and it will receive live coverage on CBS and Paramaunt+. Will the owners and their NFT collections receive some of that coverage?

Web 3.0, which the BIG3 is diving into with this NFT drop, takes you past engagement and into an empowering experience.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The NFT excels in utility, among many other things it guarantees: attendance to parties after gamedays and invites to practices. Reserved owner suites, backstage access area, player and coach meet-and-greets. Plus, a championship game experience and \u201ceven a championship ring if your team wins the whole thing.\u201d Plus, because it\u2019s the law for NFT projects, \u201ca dedicated Discord page for BIG3 owners.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, the killer app is ownership.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How Do The BIG3 NFTs Guarantee Ownership<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The new Team CEO is chosen among the 25 Fire tier NFT holders.
