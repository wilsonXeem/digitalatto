Otherwise known as The Merge, this transition of Ethereum has been applauded by many as a cornerstone in the Ethereum network.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tim Beiko, among the main developers of Ethereum, trusts that Ethereum 2.0 will unfold even later than the expected time. However, he did confirm that they are in the final phase of the transition:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNo firm date yet, but we\u2019re definitely in the final chapter of PoW on Ethereum.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a previous remark, Beiko said that he would not exactly be shocked if Ethereum 2.0 unfolds come fall, even though he did not disclose a specific date, or even month for that matter.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, \u201cThe Merge\u201d should take place prior to the beginning July 2022. Dates have been moved ahead time and time again, and as a result, it is uncertain if such estimates should be relied upon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The emphasis on sustainability is likely the most significant benefit of the switch to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Ethereum (ETH), just like <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bitcoin-hits-3-month-high-in-2022\/\">Bitcoin (BTC)<\/a> now consumes a lot of electricity to power its <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/hash-mining-guide\/\">mining<\/a> rigs which generate new blocks in the chain and validate transactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of the most recent estimates, the second-biggest digital asset network consumes well over 112 Terawatt-hours of energy yearly \u2013 more than the Philippines or Belgium.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, a single Ethereum transaction on average consumes energy north of 268 kilowatt-hours which is equivalent to a 9-day electricity consumption of an average American family household.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the beginning of the current week, developers of the blockchain network passed a significant test centered on the future transition of the protocol by issuing a \u201cshadow fork\u201d of the mainnet to test the software that is anticipated to be launched. According to Parithosh Jayanthi, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation, the fork introduces merge-related parameters to the setup of current testnets: <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn doing so, we essentially inherit the state\/txs of the canonical testnet.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per Van Der Wijden, another leading developer of the protocol, the shadow fork\u2019s introduction can be characterized as a historical moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\">\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/shibaswifecommunity\"><img src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" style=\"width:auto ;height:auto;\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/1649969747_158_ShibasWifeBannerGif3-1.gif\"\/><noscript><img src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/1649969747_158_ShibasWifeBannerGif3-1.gif\" style=\"width:auto ;height:auto;\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/is-it-finally-time-ethereum-2-0-to-commence-after-june-2022\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tim Beiko, the main developer of Ethereum (ETH), estimated that the transition to Ethereum 2.0 will place within a few months after June 2022 is over.
