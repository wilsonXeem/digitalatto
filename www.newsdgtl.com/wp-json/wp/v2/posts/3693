The factor for the NFTs&#8217; downward is the algorithmic <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-stablecoins\/\">stablecoin<\/a> TerraUSD (UST) and its crash.

Analyzing the data, we can conclude that <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum (ETH)<\/a> dropped below $2,000, while other tokens have also been under pressure.

As a result, NFT investors saw the effects of the algorithmic stablecoin loss. In this case, they could see their assets&#8217; value decrease as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Following the shrunk of NFT market liquidity, the price is on the same path of falling too.
