Clay Nation is a recent NFT player that has announced a partnership with blockchain network Cardano, and now they meet up with Snoop Dogg to provide a \u2018Baked Nation NFT.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Within Snoop\u2019s NFT drop with Clay Nation is an exclusive music project that aims to give fans some new music and more excitement on what\u2019s to come from the Dogg and Death Row records. The powerhouse label has set a bar for NFT music drops from a major label; a couple months prior, Snoop Dogg decided to rip all of his earlier work with the label from all major streaming platforms, and made them available only as NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>The deal with Snoop Dogg and crypto investor Champ Medici featured collectibles, unreleased music and plots of Clay Nation land. \u00a0The music icon and mogul had a conversation on a Twitter Space chat room about his excitement and what to expect.<\/p>\n<p>In recent tweets Snoop talked about how he feels about the partnership: \u201cMe and you come together, put together some sort of visual piece on \u2018how to\u2019 from your perspective and my perspective, you know \u2013 you come from your angle on how you got involved and I come from my angle and then we\u2019re taking care of the whole world,\u201d Snoop Dogg \u00a0said.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-489138 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1651769560_405_Screen-Shot-2022-04-27-at-8.52.34-PM-460x350.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"464\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre>ADA: Cardano on the blockchain holding right about 0.88 Tradingview.com. | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/?symbol=UPBIT%3AADAUSDT\">ADA:USDtradingview.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2>Transport Us To Baked Nation<\/h2>\n<p>Clay Nation and Snoop have figured out how to navigate and make noise in the metaverse and are showing no signs of letting up.\u00a0In a recent \u00a0statement, Clay Nation said,<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe allocated 19.5k lands for holders on a 1:1 basis (sonic and underworld) + 1,500 baked \u2013 majority of baked was public mint to welcome new people from beyond Cardano to Clay Nation which in turn benefits holders as we grow.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The current NFT market has been sluggish for several weeks now.
