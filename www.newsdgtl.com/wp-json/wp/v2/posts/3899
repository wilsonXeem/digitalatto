Per the CRS, a &#8220;run&#8221; occurs when holders have doubts about the reserves backing the asset&#8217;s US dollar parity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After this, a large number of investors withdraw their funds simultaneously, causing a negative ripple effect that undermines the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/polkadot-dogecoin-shiba-inu-reviews-2022\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a> ecosystem&#8217;s and traditional finance system&#8217;s financial stability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In conventional finance, run-like events are protected by legislation and other mechanisms such as bank deposit protection and liquidity facilities, according to the research service.

Furthermore, the CRS drew attention to existing policy measures that would limit the holdings that might be used to support stablecoins and reporting requirements enforcement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nevertheless, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently stated that the depreciation of stablecoins such as TerraUSD (UST) and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bitcoin-btc-27k-tether-below-1\/\">Tether (USDT)<\/a> poses no risk to the financial stability of the United States.
