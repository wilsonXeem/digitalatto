On Monday, Zuckerberg shared a video about the implementation of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-nft-non-fungible-tokens\/\">NFTs<\/a> on Instagram. As explained, the company is looking forward to using digital collectibles on its platforms. Additionally, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TomBilyeu?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Tom Bilyeu<\/a>, an NFT and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-web3\/\">Web 3.0<\/a> enthusiast, interviewed Zuckerberg about this new feature. In regard, Mark confirmed that they are going to test NFTs on Instagram with just a number of U.S. collectors and creators. Moreover, he noted that his company will allow these creators to display their digital collectibles.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In light of this integration on Instagram, Mark also added that this feature will be tested on Facebook in the near future. However, Zuckerberg did not give many details about the structure of the new feature, nor did he hint at how it will look. He explains that NFTs are a good way to represent something about yourself. In the chain of new features, Mark revealed some of Meta\u2019s plans. He said that Meta plans to add extended reality NFTs to Instagram Stories. They will enable this through their own augmented reality platform called <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/sparkar.facebook.com\/ar-studio\/\">Spark AR<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Potential of Meta<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Following some rumors, Meta is looking to add support for some platforms like <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/polygon-matic-price-prediction-2021-2\/\">Polygon<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/solana-price-prediction-2022\/\">Solana<\/a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/flow-price-prediction-2022\/\">Flow<\/a> NFTs. Nonetheless, in the published video, Mark did not reveal what networks the initiative will run on. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning the potential of Meta to launch its own NFT-compatible <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchain<\/a>. However, this development would require new infrastructure and a user base. In the meantime, most NFT traders today trade on Ethereum and Solana.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In March, Zuckerberg hinted at Meta&#8217;s ambitions to support NFTs but gave no further details. NFT enthusiasts assumed that Meta might move into the digital collectibles realm. These assumptions come as other large firms and technological apps such as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\">Twitter<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/youtube.com\">YouTube<\/a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/reddit.com\">Reddit<\/a> show support for the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">crypto<\/a> creator-driven space. In October, Zuckerberg stated that Facebook had been rebranded Meta, indicating that the corporation would soon be heavily involved in the crypto sector.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/zuckerberg-confirms-testing-nfts-instagram\/\">CEO of Facebook Confirms Testing NFTs on Instagram<\/a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\">Crypto Academy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/zuckerberg-confirms-testing-nfts-instagram\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, confirms that they will be testing the integration of NFTs on Instagram next week.
