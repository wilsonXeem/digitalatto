The current state of affairs, in which mining is neither legal nor illegal and falls under the jurisdiction of the federal government, is detrimental to further growth of the industry, he said.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe legal vacuum makes it difficult to regulate this area and set clear rules of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we want somehow to get along with this activity and we have no other options in the current reality, we must introduce legal regulation, adding the concept of mining to the regulatory framework.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">According to a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/tass.com\/economy\/1427807\">report<\/a> from Russian state news agency Tass, Grabchak also noted that it should be regional governments that regulate mining. He explained that it would be more efficient that regional authorities to have the autonomy to select appropriate sites for mining and free energy capacities for miners at the regional level.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The federal government should relinquish all control over the industry, ditching any development plans and caps on energy consumption it might have on a federal level. Energy consumption should be capped in regional development plans, which will create a more efficient market.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And while this is in line with the recent <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/russia-selling-gas-and-oil-for-bitcoins\/\">push<\/a> from Russian officials to adopt cryptocurrencies in foreign trade, it\u2019s a full 180 from the position the country\u2019s central bank took just a couple of months ago.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In January, Russia\u2019s central bank <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/finance\/russian-cbank-proposes-banning-cryptocurrencies-crypto-mining-2022-01-20\/\">proposed<\/a> banning both mining and the use of cryptocurrencies on Russian territory, saying they threaten the country\u2019s financial stability, the wellbeing of its citizens, and the sovereignty of its monetary policy.<\/p>\n<div id=\"revue-embed\"> <span class=\"screenshot\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"top\">\n<p><h2>Get your daily recap of <span class=\"orange\">Bitcoin<\/span>, <span class=\"blue\">DeFi<\/span>, <span class=\"pink\">NFT<\/span> and <span class=\"green\">Web3<\/span> news from CryptoSlate<\/h2>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"edge-cta hidden\">\n<h2>Get an <span>Edge<\/span> on the Crypto Market \ud83d\udc47<\/h2>\n<p>Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cols\">\n<p> <span class=\"img chart\"\/> <strong>On-chain analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> <span class=\"img price\"\/> <strong>Price snapshots<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> <span class=\"img context\"\/> <strong>More context<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.memberful.com\/checkout?plan=43765\" class=\"btn join\">Join now for $19\/month<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/edge\/\" class=\"btn\">Explore all benefits<\/a><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/the-tables-are-turning-in-russia-as-energy-minister-calls-for-the-legalization-of-crypto-mining\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Russia\u2019s Deputy Minister of Energy said that cryptocurrency mining in the country should be fully legalized as soon as possible.
