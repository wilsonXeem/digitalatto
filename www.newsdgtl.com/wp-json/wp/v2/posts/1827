We were an official media partner for the event, which hosted over 100 talks and 1,500 attendees. The two day conference was teeming with NFT enthusiasm from all corners, filled with amazing creators and projects, art shows, and speakers.<\/p>\n<p>The best part was that we not only got to meet many of these talented creators, but we also interviewed them on camera! Yes, that\u2019s right, the <strong>NFT Plazas team<\/strong> got up from behind our screens and took to the stage. We\u2019re delighted to have connected in person with builders, creators, founders, and investors of the NFT community. It was a truly unique experience and one that we won\u2019t forget any time soon.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>NFT Plazas has become a <strong>leading source for NFT news<\/strong> and a recognized brand in NFT media over the past year, as well as the go-to place for everything happening in the space. Our <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nftplazas.com\/nft-plazas-team\/\">team<\/a> has grown immensely as a large number of cutting edge writers who are experts in various NFT segments have joined us in delivering educational content and news. Unfortunately, only of a few us, who were currently in Europe, were able to make it to the conference, but you\u2019ll certainly be seeing more of us across the globe at various conferences!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-36114 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-04-12-at-11.59.10-AM-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve got some exciting footage coming up, all shot by our <strong>professional cameraman<\/strong> who joined us specially for the conference.

The panel featured Marie from Nabiya, Vaughan from Primordial Studios, and Johan from Parishanghaitop, all of whom are top entrepreneurs in the space working on building in the metaverse, particularly in The Sandbox. The discussion, which caught everyone\u2019s attention and had a large turnout with all seats taken up, gave insights into how these entrepreneurs are navigating the space, what the future of work will look like,<strong> job opportunities in the metaverse<\/strong>, and what it\u2019s like building in The Sandbox.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-36115 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-04-12-at-11.58.27-AM.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1078\" height=\"634\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>We are so grateful to everyone who participated in the event and to the organisers, thank you for putting it all together.
