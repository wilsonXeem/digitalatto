The international community imposed sanctions on the former country as a response.<\/p>\n<p>Russia has been cut off from the international financial system, its social elite has been punished, and its gold reserves seized. The Vladimir Putin-led country and other superpowers, Hayes argued in his thesis, will push to dethrone the U.S. dollars as a global reserve currency.<\/p>\n<p>This will lead to higher Gold and Bitcoin prices as people will flee to stores of value, and neutral monetary systems. Hayes\u2019 latest post follows this idea of the global financial crisis that will benefit cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<h2>Hayes Prediction On Ethereum, Why The Financial Sector Will Embrace It<\/h2>\n<p>The former BitMEX argued that Ethereum will see appreciation on the back of two main factors. First, the full deployment of ETH 2.0 capabilities with \u201cThe Merge\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>This event will join Ethereum\u2019s execution layer or ETH 1.0 with its consensus layer or ETH 2.0, the Proof-of-Stake blockchain. Set to reduce ETH\u2019s network energy consumption by 99%, it\u2019ll provide the digital asset with a strong narrative: it\u2019ll become ESG-compliant.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, institutions will be able to trade and create investment products based on the cryptocurrency without facing backlash based on its consensus algorithm. When Tesla invested in Bitcoin, the company\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk, had to stop accepting it as a form of payment.<\/p>\n<p>The first crypto is considered a threat to the environment by its detractors.<\/p>\n<p>Post Merge, Ethereum will provide its node validators with rewards for staking ETH and securing the network. This will create another narrative, Ethereum could be deemed a bond for the benefit of the \u201cfinancial advisors\u201d, for the elite in the financial sector.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, it could see greater adoption. Hayes explained:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(\u2026) paired with ETH 2.0\u2019s ESG-compliant label (another stamp of intellectual ossification), and protocol metrics that are more attractive than the cadre of layer-1 (L1) \u201cEthereum killers\u201d makes ETH supremely undervalued on a relative basis vs. Bitcoin, fiat, and other L1 competitors.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>ETH Holders Will Be The Biggest Winners<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cThe Merge\u201d will provide stakers, according to data provided by Hayes, with an initial 8% to 11.5% Annual Percentage Rate (APR). As an asset operating like a bond ETH will present new investment opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>A bond is a form of debt created between two parties, a company, government, or in this case the Ethereum network. Beyond a simple price prediction, Hayes invited traders to consider this new possibility as ETH prepares for its upcoming \u201cMerge\u201d. He said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you believe that ETH can or should be valued as a bond, then as an investor \u2013 given your long-term interest rate and ETH reward assumptions \u2013 you should be willing to buy ETH at today\u2019s prices (\u2026)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This trading opportunity, along with the full deployment of its PoS capabilities will attract fresh capital. Money from \u201cESG-friendly\u201d investors looking for crypto exposure, but unable to obtain as long as PoW is the dominant consensus algorithm. Hayes added:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sentiment will all change when ETH becomes an ESG-friendly, POS blockchain, which ESG funds can then invest in. This opens up ETH to hundreds of billions of USD worth of fiduciaries who due to ETH\u2019s classification, can now safely invest (\u2026).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Related Reading |<\/strong> <strong><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/eth\/ethereum-trims-gains-3200\/\">TA: Ethereum Trims Gains, $3,200 Is The Key<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the coming months, Hayes believes ETH will outperform in the layer-1 sector.
