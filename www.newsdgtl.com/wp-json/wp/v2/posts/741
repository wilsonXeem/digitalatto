Stronghold Digital Mining generates power by recycling waste from old coal-fired power plants to generate electricity for hundreds of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bitcoin-will-not-help-russia-avoid-sanctions\/\">Bitcoin (BTC)<\/a> mining rigs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Greg Beard, the CEO of Stronghold confirmed that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cthe Bitcoin mining network itself is the largest decentralized computer network in the world, and it\u2019s power hungry, so co-locating Bitcoin mining and a power plant makes a lot of sense.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Coal ash, a product of coal-burning to create electricity, has the ability to flow into water and harm streams as it is carcinogenic and hazardous due to the high concentration of heavy metals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The company takes the coal ash from a mine nearby. This coal ash is then treated at the Stronghold-owned and operated waste coal processing plant. Next, there is a process where the coal ash is separated from the other waste components and pulverized. The last step includes the burning of the coal ash in a boiler building whereby the power necessary to fuel the Bitcoin (BTC) mining setups is generated.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The co-chairman of Stronghold Digital Mining, Bill Spence referred to the method as<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u201ca perfect niche for crypto.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Notwithstanding the debates over the power intake of Bitcoin (BTC) and the subsequent environmental impact, a study from two months ago confirmed that in 2021, the biggest cryptocurrency was only responsible for 0.08% of CO2 emissions, thus positing that there is an exaggeration on the power consumption of crypto mining.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bitcoin (BTC) is created through a process otherwise known as mining. In exchange for the cryptocurrency, which is distributed in the form of Bitcoin (BTC), systems must solve complex riddles. It takes a massive amount of energy to keep said devices up and running.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the biggest cryptocurrency rises in prominence, more people are mining Bitcoin (BTC) using unusual techniques. One cryptocurrency fanatic, in particular, has created a 6kW solar-powered (BTC) mining setup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In another case, an old New York power plant used spare electricity to mine Bitcoin (BTC) rather than sell it in 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/community-care-us-company-to-use-coal-waste-for-btc-mining\/\">Community Care: US Company to Use Coal Waste for BTC Mining<\/a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\">Crypto Academy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/community-care-us-company-to-use-coal-waste-for-btc-mining\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The massive amounts of energy needed for Bitcoin (BTC) mining have sparked a controversy about if the energy necessary to generate the biggest cryptocurrency is worth the environmental risks associated that emerge as a consequence.
