The analyst has been closely following BTC and ETH\u2019s price performance using the On-Balance-Volume (OBV), a metric used to measure price momentum.<\/p>\n<p>While the analyst believes both cryptocurrencies \u201clook good\u201d, he shared Ethereum\u2019s OBV chart to support a bullish thesis for this asset and its potential to run higher than BTC. The analyst said: \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m holding ETH and selling a LITTLE of BTC\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>As ETH\u2019s OBV shows in the chart below, the cryptocurrency broke a downside trend which started in November 2021. At that time, ETH\u2019s OBV stood at around 19 million and descended into a 14 million low last February.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_486844\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-486844\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-486844 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Ethereum-ETH-ETHUSD-860x407.jpg\" alt=\"Ethereum ETH ETHUSD\" width=\"860\" height=\"407\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-486844\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: IncomeSharks via Twitter.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>When Ethereum managed to break the bearish trendline, it hinted at the possibility of reclaiming more of its OBV and maybe making a run into the $4,000. ETH is currently approaching 17 million in OBV.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, Bitcoin is yet to break above its OBV trendline. Therefore, it could see some crab-like price action until either bulls or bears push for their benefit. At current levels and in a short timeframe, the analyst expects BTC to pull back on some of its gains.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_486845\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-486845\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-486845 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Ethereum-ETH-ETHUSD-860x406.png\" alt=\"Ethereum ETH ETHUSD\" width=\"860\" height=\"406\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-486845\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: IncomeSharks via Twitter<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>The Merge Drives Ethereum Higher<\/h2>\n<p>However, Bitcoin and Ethereum might profit further in April, when the crypto has historically experienced profits. The analyst said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bitcoin seems to love April 1st. It has marked the local bottoms before and been almost the exact bottom before a bull run several times. Minus last year, was a local top, it\u2019s been a very pivotal date. Seeing we\u2019ve already corrected I\u2019m leaning towards an exciting April 1st.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>ETH\u2019s price current rally could be supported by the imminent launch of \u201cThe Merge\u201d. The event will combine Ethereum\u2019s execution layer with its consensus layer supported by a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Related Reading | <\/strong><strong><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-miner-revenue-grows-by-7-heres-how-much-they-made\/\">Bitcoin Miner Revenue Grows By 7%.
