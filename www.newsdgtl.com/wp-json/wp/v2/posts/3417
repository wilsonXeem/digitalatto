For example, Entertainment Asset Pte, Ltd, or DEA, is working with INIMI to launch a digital idol project. In addition, working with a music artist collective will lead to a limited set of music NFTs, ushering in a new era for non-fungible tokens.<\/p>\n<h3>Project B-IDOL Is Coming Soon<\/h3>\n<p>NFT technology often revolves around digital artwork, which can be linked to real-world art, although it doesn\u2019t have to be. However, non-fungible tokens are not limited to images, as they can also represent video, music, or other files. The <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/project-b-idol.com\/\">Project B-Idol <\/a>NFT collection will span a limited number of music NFTs, introducing a different take on the non-fungible token concept.<\/p>\n<p>The collection results from a collaboration between DEA and INIMI, the music artist collective directed by SUNNY BOY. A collaborative effort will often help reach a broader audience and bring more credibility to a new NFT collection. DEA and INIMI will launch the collection in the summer of 2022 on the BNB Chain. Moreover, users can acquire the assets through PlayMining NFT Premier, the NFT marketplace built by the DEA team.<\/p>\n<p><strong>An INIMI spokesperson adds:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cIt is a great honor for us to participate in the B-idol project. We have always been very interested in the NFT scene, so we are thrilled to have been asked to participate in this project. We wrote this song with a wish to warm the hearts of people who are experiencing tragic events currently going around the world. We hope our thoughts and prayers will reach as many people as possible.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Project B-idol is a digital idol project developed as NFTs. The limited number of music NFTs will cover various styles of music produced by artist collaborations and community-initiated music productions. Furthermore, creators of these music NFTs can partake in producing Project B-idol through a community voting process. That voting will help determine the future direction of the project.<\/p>\n<h3>PlayMining Continues To Build Momentum<\/h3>\n<p>The collab between DEA and INIMI is another feather in the cap of the PlayMining team. DEA spearheads the PlayMining initiative to remove secondary market issues for creators and consumers through GameFi elements. Moreover, PlayMining lets anyone play blockchain games and earn DEP tokens for participation. Holders can leverage these DEP tokens to purchase NFTs on the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nft-premier.playmining.com\/\">PlayMining NFT Premier marketplace<\/a>, including accessing the Project B-idol collection.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, DEA and PlayMining step up their game through the INIMI collaboration. INIMI has established itself as a collective of Tokyo-based artists known for their music featuring pop-culture crossovers. Moreover, INIMI empowers Asian artists and enables them to collaborate globally. The team includes core members such as Monjoe, Cheney, Canchild, Kosuke. etc.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/company\/playmining-nft-premier-will-host-project-b-idol-music-nfts-product-by-inimi\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Artist collaborations will play a key role in the future of NFT development.
