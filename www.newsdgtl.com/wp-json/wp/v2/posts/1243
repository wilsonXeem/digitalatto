The Lightning Network is much more than that, though.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What will happen once Kraken\u2019s extensive clientele tries out Lightning transactions? Will the phenomenal experience change the way they see bitcoin? The second layer solution can perform millions of operations per second and all transactions cost pennies and offer final settlement. In using it, there are also privacy gains. The huge innovation, though, is the cash-like experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Kraken integration comes with a <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/amboss.space\/node\/02f1a8c87607f415c8f22c00593002775941dea48869ce23096af27b0cfdcc0b69\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lightning node of their own<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. To implement it, the company used LND by Lightning Labs. The reason is that \u201cthey have the largest user base and we have a lot of people on the network that have lots of experience with LND. So it has proven to be easy to use and very reliable as well.\u201d That\u2019s according to Kraken\u2019s bitcoin product manager, Pierre Rochard, who also <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinmagazine.com\/business\/kraken-exchange-integrates-bitcoins-lightning-network\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">said to Bitcoin Magazine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAdoption is going to come from people who have fiat in their bank account, and they need to get it into Bitcoin. Kraken is providing an excellent venue for them to do that, and then they can top up their mobile Lightning wallet and use it as a medium of exchange. That\u2019s clearly the next step in terms of Bitcoin\u2019s evolution.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Designed with this and the cash-like experience in mind, Kraken limits Lightning deposits and withdrawals to 0.1 BTC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-487447 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/BTCUSD_2022-04-02_10-41-42-460x257.png\" alt=\"BTCUSD price chart for 04\/02\/2022 - TradingView\" width=\"460\" height=\"257\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC price chart for 04\/02\/2022 on Binance | Source: BTC\/USD on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/BTCUSD\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kraken Announced Lightning Network Integration In 2020<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even though this looks like it magically happened, the integration had been in the works for a while.

Market-wise, will this move the needle in favor of bitcoin? Will the world even notice? According <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/theDavidCoen\/LightningExchanges\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to this list<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Kraken became the 23rd exchange to support the Lightning Network. Among the giant ones already on board are Bitfinex, OKEx, OKcoin, BitMex, and Bitstamp. Among the up-and-coming ones, BullBitcoin, Buda, CoinCorner, Kollider, and Boltz.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This also means, that you&#8217;re able to instantly move the lightning payment you received to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/krakenfx?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@krakenfx<\/a> to exchange it for fiat, basically reducing the currency exchange risk to zero.<br \/>This completely changes the dynamic for fiat brick and mortar stores.<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/bpNzKC7ZDL\">https:\/\/t.co\/bpNzKC7ZDL<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 zero fee routing \u26a1 (@zerofeerouting) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/zerofeerouting\/status\/1509532038319157263?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 31, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And, since we\u2019re on lists, in their announcement Kraken provided Lightning wallet recommendations:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cFor example, <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/btcpayserver.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">BTCPay Server<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> enables Lightning payments for merchants, greatly improving the bitcoin checkout flow.

The community could clean up the disgusting ESG-based narrative enemies of bitcoin have been planting in mainstream media. Regarding this, in the already quoted interview Kraken\u2019s Pierre Rochard said:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWith Lightning, you can send a payment off-chain that is much more energy efficient, not only because you\u2019re not adding the miner fees, and thus the amount of electricity consumption by miners, but also because that payment only has to be stored and shared by the two parties in that channel.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinist.com\/ripple-greenpeace-ridiculous-campaign-bitcoin-pos\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Greenpeace and Ripple<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> not know that most bitcoin transactions are going to be off-chain in a few years? Do they not know that the Lightning Network alone will take bitcoin out of the conversation its enemies have been carefully manufacturing? Kraken certainly knows. And took action.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Speaking about Kraken, its CEO Jess Powell has been present on the news lately.
