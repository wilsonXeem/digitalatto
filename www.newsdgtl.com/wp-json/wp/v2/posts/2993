It follows on the back of bitcoin listing its footing above the $40,000 level last week, although the digital asset has done a good job holding above the $36,000 support level. However, it seems that the end of this bear trend may not be near given some recent chart action happening in the stock market. If this prediction comes to fruition, then the market may see more value shaved off its market cap soon.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">A Dot Com-Like Crash?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Peter Brandt has recently posted a concerning chart that shows eerie similarities to the dot com crash of the early 2000s. Brandt is known for predicting the crypto market crash of 2018 and is a respected chartist in the space. Having proven to know his charts, his predictions have become quite popular among crypto investors.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/bitcoin-consolidates-below-39k\/\">TA: Bitcoin Consolidates Below $39k: What Could Trigger Another Decline<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">This is why Brandt posting a chart of the Nasdaq 100 that looks like that of the dot com chart right before the crash has worried investors. Basically, if this turns out to be like what happened in 2001, then the market may see a lot of stocks lose their value very quickly.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/ViErLXLv\/\" alt=\"Bitcoin price chart from TradingView.com\" width=\"3278\" height=\"1758\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC recovers above $38,000 | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/TradingView.com\">BTCUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p class=\"p2\">Now, it is important to note that the Nasdaq is trading at a significantly higher point than it did in the early 2000s. However, the recent market movements seem to closely mirror the movements recorded before the crash. Brandt has termed this deja vu with arrows pointing out the similar market patterns from both points in time.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;It&#8217;s Deja Vu all over again&#8221;<br \/>\u2013Yogi Berra, late 20th Century American philosopher <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/aFch8sx1PA\">pic.twitter.com\/aFch8sx1PA<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PeterLBrandt\/status\/1517285802090188800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 21, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">How This Affects Crypto<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">As the crypto market has gotten bigger, the correlation with the stock market has risen drastically over the past few months. This has closely tied the movement of the stock market to that of the crypto market. What this means is that when the stock market goes up, so does the crypto market, and vice versa.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Therefore, a dot com magnitude crash in the stock market could have some dire implications for the crypto market. If stocks were to lose a significant portion of their value over a short period of time, the crypto market is likely to follow, leading to massive crashes across both large and small cryptocurrencies alike.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-struggles-to-hold-40k-while-crypto-track-us-stocks\/\">Bitcoin Struggles To Hold $40K While Crypto Track US Stocks<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">This does not fall far from Brandt\u2019s prediction for the leading digital asset in the crypto market. Bitcoin which continues to face opposition at the $40,000 mark may decline to as low as $28,000 <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PeterLBrandt\/status\/1520551413968908288?s=20&amp;t=XzW28f9BYjegt5UFBlJJtA\">according<\/a> to Brandt. This would be the completion of a bear channel, he added.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Regardless of whether a dot com-like burst is imminent or not, indicators for the crypto market are currently not favorable. With the market down almost 50% from its all-time high, there may be more downtrend to come as investor sentiment continues to shift into the negative.<\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Featured image from CNBC, chart from TradingView.com<\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/crypto\/brace-for-impact-a-dot-com-magnitude-crash-to-rock-the-crypto-market\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The crypto market has been through a rollercoaster of a weekend.
