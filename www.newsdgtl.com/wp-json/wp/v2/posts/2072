The aim of this video is to explain everything about Bitcoin mining.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Musk shared the video on the 1st of April. The initiative comes as a reply to a tweet about Bitcoin by Ark Invest\u2019s director of research, Brett Winton. In the tweet, Winton talked about a conversation he had with his mom on the 1st of April. The topic was BTC mining. In regard, he found it difficult to explain to his mom that <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/hash-mining-guide\/\">BTC miners<\/a> are computers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In response to this tweet, Musk came to help with a meme video called &#8221; \u00d0 is for \u00d0ogecoin\u201d. Moreover, he suggested showing this video to her. Everything explained is in there, added Musk.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Just show her this video explains everything <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/UEEocOfcTb\">https:\/\/t.co\/UEEocOfcTb<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1510001831526617092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 1, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The DOGE Video<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the short video, the DOGE mascot takes a trip to the moon. Through this feature, it represents the price of DOGE had skyrocketed. In the meantime, Shiba Inu is represented on a rocket passing Bitcoin and other major currencies. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Correspondingly, Winton responded to Musk after watching the video. A meme that goes too far for her, I&#8217;m afraid,\u201d he said. In contrast, his 5-year-old is now trying to open a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/coinbase-review\/\">Coinbase <\/a>account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Regarding the video, Dogecoin co-creator <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BillyM2k?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Billy Markus<\/a> expressed his opinion. He said that the meme video was the greatest cryptocurrency video in history. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As per the record, Musk has previously posted this video on Twitter, on Feb. 7 of last year. He shared the video with the title: &#8220;\u00d0 is for \u00d0ogecoin! Instructive video.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Following on the DOGE community, it is a big deal that Elon Musk tweeted about the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a> again. He is known as the &#8220;Dogefather&#8221; because his tweets have pushed the price of Dogecoin up for a long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DOGE the 12th Largest Cryptocurrency<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bitcoin.com Markets data shows that Dogecoin is ranked the 12th largest cryptocurrency by <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\">market capitalization<\/a>. At this time of writing, it is trading at $0.1431 per coin. However, Musk&#8217;s newest DOGE tweet had little effect on the market. As of the time he tweeted, the meme coin was trading at about $0.1420.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to Musk, he holds Bitcoin, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a>, and Dogecoin. In particular, he has made it clear that he will not be selling any of these digital assets. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\">Elon Musk<\/a> believes that DOGE is the ideal cryptocurrency to use for transactions. He thinks DOGE is the people&#8217;s crypto. On the other hand, Musk views BTC as a form of a financial asset. There are a few products at his company that may be purchased using DOGE.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/elon-musk-dogecoin-video\/\">Elon Musk Shills For Dogecoin Once Again<\/a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\">Crypto Academy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/elon-musk-dogecoin-video\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk shared a Dogecoin video on Twitter.
