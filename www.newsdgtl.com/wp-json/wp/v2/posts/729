Each day, new NFT projects join the market, and most of them successfully sell out. In late-2021, the world turned its eyes to NFTs and the Metaverse. Surprisingly enough, the majority of the people did not know that these two are directly linked with one another.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we talk about the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-decentralized-finance\/\">decentralized finance (DeFi)<\/a> ecosystem, trying to separate cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and the Metaverse is impossible. You need cryptocurrencies to keep DeFi truly decentralized; people use cryptocurrencies to buy NFTs; you need NFTs to create a Metaverse; you need <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrencies<\/a> to trade inside a Metaverse; the list goes on. Everything is interlinked with one another in the DeFi space. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just recently, the BAYC-inspired token <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/apecoin-price-prediction-2022\/\">ApeCoin<\/a> made its debut. This token did not even need marketing to skyrocket and reach a market capitalization of more than $4 billion the day it launched. Moreover, ApeCoin is one of the few <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/altcoin-definition-what-is-an-altcoin\/\">altcoins<\/a>, if not the only one, that got listed in every major <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-exchange\/\">exchange<\/a> the day of its debut. But what exactly is ApeCoin and what does the future hold for it?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is ApeCoin?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamentally, ApeCoin is an <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/erc-20-tokens-explained\/\">ERC-20 token<\/a> operating on the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a> blockchain. This token was launched by members of the BAYC community in cooperation with Yuga Labs. Yuga Labs, on the other hand, are the creators of the Bored Ape Yach Club collection. That being said, the community of BAYC\/MAYC\/BAKC supported the coin as well.\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some days after launching ApeCoin, Yuga Labs teased their upcoming Metaverse, Otherside. In that video, you can see NFTs such as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptopunks-why-are-cryptopunks-so-expensive\/\">CryptoPunks<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bored-apes-price\/\">Bored Apes<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/meebits.larvalabs.com\/\">MeeBits<\/a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/worldofwomen.art\/\">World of Women<\/a>. Allegedly, the Otherside will be powered by ApeCoin.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">See you on the Otherside in April.

Each day, ApeCoin has billions in trading volume. Having a high <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/understanding-crypto-trading-volume\/\">trading volume<\/a> just ensures investors that there is enough liquidity in the market. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Dextools, ApeCoin set an all-time high of more than $50 the day of its debut. With the current supply, reaching such a price would mean that ApeCoin hit a market capitalization between $10-$15 billion immediately after it joined the market. Achieving such a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\">market capitalization<\/a> in such a short time in the market is not always a good thing, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ApeCoin Price Prediction 2025<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We at <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/category\/price-prediction\/\"><b>Crypto Academy<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tend to look at each factor when it comes to presenting our price predictions. After thorough research, we came up with the ApeCoin price prediction for 2025.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ApeCoin Price Prediction 2025 Q1<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first quarter of 2025 might not be that good for ApeCoin. This is because of the market performance that this token is likely to have in 2024 \u2013 the year when the next <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin-halving\/\">Bitcoin halving<\/a> will occur. By the end of the 1st quarter of 2025, our forecast shows ApeCoin trading between $65-$80.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ApeCoin Price Prediction 2025 Q2<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After possibly experiencing a slow start to the year, ApeCoin might begin an uptrend in the 2nd quarter of 2025. Considering the trading volume and the interest for ApeCoin, this token is likely to achieve a market capitalization x50 the one it has at the time of writing this article. However, you should also consider the fact of the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-circulating-supply-and-maximum-supply\/\">circulating supply<\/a>. Currently, only a small portion of the supply is in circulation. By the 2nd quarter of 2025, most, if not all, of the supply will be in circulation. This is likely to affect the price of the token. Our prediction shows APE trading between $90-$110 by the end of the 2nd quarter.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ApeCoin Price Prediction 2025 Q3<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After potentially experiencing considerable growth during the 2nd quarter of 2025, we believe that APE could dip a bit. This dip is likely to be caused by \u201cpaper hands\u201d who usually cash out when they are in profit. However, summer is known for being more hostile to the cryptocurrency market performance. During this period of time, the price per one APE might drop to $70-$80. Despite this, though, there is a high chance that APE might not break its <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-the-support-zone\/\">support zone<\/a>\u00a0at $90 and sit around that price for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ApeCoin Price Prediction 2025 Q4<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At last, the 4th quarter of 2025 is likely to be the best period of that year. This is because our forecast shows APE reaching a new all-time high during this period. Considering the level of crypto adoption and the several incoming partnerships of APE with huge names in the industry, each price increase is welcome. By the end of 2025, APE is likely to be <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/investing-vs-trading-crypto\/\">trading<\/a> at a new all-time high of $150.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_23882\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-23882\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-23882 size-full\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"ApeCoin Price Prediction 2025\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-6.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-23882 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-6.png\" alt=\"ApeCoin Price Prediction 2025\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-23882\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>ApeCoin Price Prediction for 2025.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeaways<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NFTs and the Metaverse go together, and so do cryptocurrencies.
