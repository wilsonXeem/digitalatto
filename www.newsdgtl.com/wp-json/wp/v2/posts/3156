However, there is a fear in the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a> industry. Many fear that China&#8217;s decision to ban NFTs is the end of the road for further growth of NFTs.

The main reason for this limitation is that crypto <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/investing-vs-trading-crypto\/\">trading<\/a> is illegal in China. Moreover, instead of calling them NFTs, technology companies call them &#8220;digital collectibles.&#8221; This way, they highlight the use case&#8217;s aim of establishing ownership and authenticity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Advantages of NFTs Utility<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A key function of NFTs is to support the growth of the creative and cultural sectors. This importance is highlighted by the financial associations&#8217; statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Furthermore, NFTs are minted on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a> or other public chains and exchanged with cryptocurrency on open <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-exchange\/\">exchanges<\/a>. On the contrary, digital collectibles generated in China are typically released on &#8220;permissioned blockchains.&#8221; In addition, they are sold through the channels of local tech firms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Following the process of the purchase of the collectibles with Yuan fiat currency, consumers must first establish their authenticity on these sites. In regard, users would be prohibited from reselling the collectibles once they had bought them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As per regulations, regulators in China treat digital collectibles as a separate sector from the global NFT market. This makes them extremely difficult to trade. Despite all difficulties, Chinese tech giants are pushing forward the development of digital collectibles. With this in mind, some have gone so far as to sell NFTs outside of China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/china-tech-titans-are-betting-on-nfts\/\">Despite the Crypto Ban, China&#8217;s Tech Titans are Betting on NFTs<\/a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\">Crypto Academy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/china-tech-titans-are-betting-on-nfts\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Several Chinese business organizations made a warning in the middle of April about the potential financial risks of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
