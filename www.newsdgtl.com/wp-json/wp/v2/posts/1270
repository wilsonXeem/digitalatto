This is the first time the mining difficulty will go up since February.<\/p>\n<p>The mining difficulty describes how difficult it can get for miners to find a block reward. The essence of the mining difficulty is to ensure that the network stays consistent. The period between each block reward is usually around 10 minutes, and the difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA) adjusts every two weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, the mining difficulty increases as the hash rate increases. The hash rate, which is the network computing power, increases as mining participants join the network.<\/p>\n<p>With a higher hash rate, the DAA adjusts mining difficulty to match the rate and make it more difficult for miners to find a block.<\/p>\n<p>The latest increase in mining difficulty saw it rise by 4.31%, the first time in 4 weeks.
