It has not been spared from the general market downtrend that has rocked the crypto space and has since lost its footing above $3,000, a crucial point for the digital asset. Nevertheless, it seems the future is not at all gloomy for the second-largest cryptocurrency going by reports from a Finder\u2019s panel.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Ethereum To Surge 100%<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">A recent Finder\u2019s <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.finder.com\/finder-experts-see-ethereum-doubling-this-year\">panel<\/a> made up of industry experts has released an extremely bullish long-term outlook for the cryptocurrency. The panel which took part in the quarterly survey from Finder consisted of 36 industry experts who shared their forecasts for the digital asset. According to them, Ethereum may very well still be in the early stages of its growth price-wise.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The digital asset which is currently trading a little above $2,800 received some of the best feedback and the consensus was that there is much growing to do in 2022 alone. They put forward that ETH will see another 100% growth this year that would see its price hit as high as $5,783 before the year runs out.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/crypto\/brace-for-impact-a-dot-com-magnitude-crash-to-rock-the-crypto-market\/\">Brace For Impact: A Dot Com Magnitude Crash To Rock The Crypto Market?<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cEthereum will jump from its current price of US$2,810 to US$5,783 by the end of 2022,\u201d the panel said. \u201cThe price is expected to continue to rise going forward, hitting $11,764 by 2025 and $23,372 by 2030.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Despite the bullish outlook for the altcoin going from current perspectives, it is more bearish compared to the previous predictions. The panel had previously put Ethereum\u2019s price at $6,500 by the end of the year 2022, but the recent quarterly report has seen them adjust this prediction by about 10%. Nevertheless, it remains a good outlook for the digital asset.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Not everyone shared the bullish outlook for ETH though. One expert, John Hawkins, senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, said he sees the digital asset ending the year below $2,000.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/SuVk6slC\/\" alt=\"Ethereum price chart from TradingView.com\" width=\"3278\" height=\"1758\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">ETH price trending at $2,800 | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/TradingView.com\">ETHUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">How This Will Happen<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">There are a lot of predictions going around for Ethereum which all hinge on the upcoming upgrades on the network. The move to the consensus layer that will see the network move to the proof of stake mechanism is an upgrade that is anticipated to bolster the value of the token and Finder\u2019s experts seem to think so too.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Keegan Francis who is the global cryptocurrency editor at Finder explained that for him, the long-term outlook for the cryptocurrency remains pretty bleak until the upgrades are carried out. With this would come the ability to scale for the network. However, Francis added that people will continue to buy the cryptocurrency due to \u201chype, promise, and potential.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/eth\/ethereum-shows-positive-signs-2920\/\">TA: Ethereum Shows Positive Signs But This Resistance Is The Key<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The network still remains the leading DeFi platform. But with it losing so much market share to competitors, the cryptocurrency editor does not have a lot of confidence right now. \u201cEthereum is at a very uncertain place in its journey at the moment,\u201d Francis explained. \u201cIt is currently losing DeFi (decentralized finance) market share to its competitors.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Ethereum continues to trade above $2,800 in the early hours of Tuesday. Its price is up 0.15% in the last 24 hours to be trading at $2,843 at the time of this writing.<\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Featured image from CoinQuora, chart from TradingView.com<\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/eth\/experts-say-ethereum-will-grow-100-to-hit-5783-by-year-end\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ethereum remains one of the most successful cryptocurrencies in the market, although its current price does leave a lot to be desired.
