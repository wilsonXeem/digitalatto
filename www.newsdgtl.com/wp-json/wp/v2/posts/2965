As its title, the \u2018ACFC Inaugural Fan Pass Collection,\u2019 suggests, the NFT offering is a celebration of the club\u2019s first match, which took place on April 29th.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>To be eligible to obtain one of the free and commemorative NFTs, fans will have to be a preexisting user of the <strong>Crypto.com NFT marketplace<\/strong>, or alternatively, sign up to the platform during the exclusive <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto.com\/nft\/register\">sign up window<\/a>. Upon gaining eligibility, fans will be able to receive either a \u2018Kickoff\u2019 or \u2018Sol Rosa Kickoff\u2019 NFT, with the former being a digital, stylised soccer ball with the ACFC crest floating within it, and the latter being duplicate of the former, however, with a washed over, Sol Rosa-coloured finish to it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The NFTs will be distributed on<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto.com\/nft\/acfc\"> Crypto.com<\/a> from the date of the club\u2019s inaugural match, up until <strong>9PM PST on May 5th<\/strong>. There will be 22 Sol Rosa Kickoff NFTs on offer which\u2019ll each be gifted at random to 22 lucky fans, with all other participants to receive a Kickoff NFT.<\/p>\n<p>The reason the Sol Rosa Kickoff NFT series has a limited supply of 22 is because this particular number pays homage to multiple facets of the club, including its year of establishment, home stadium capacity (in thousands), and its Player 22 Future Program. The program provides grants to retired National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL) players who are starting new careers within sport. With this in mind, ACFC will be donating to the program\u2019s fund at the conclusion of the NFT redemption period, to coincide with the number of NFTs claimed.<\/p>\n<p>Once the NFT redemption period is over, the team will communicate directly with holders to share access to exclusive digital items and invitations to virtual and physical events throughout its first competitive<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>season.<\/p>\n<p>The events may be those included within ACFC\u2019s and Crypto.com\u2019s multiyear agreement, which includes live and virtual events to educate the community on the development of <strong>Web3, cryptocurrencies, NFTs,<\/strong> and all other activities in the blockchain space.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Upon its arrival into the professional sports scene, ACFC became the 11th member of the US\u2019s NWSL. With the US arguably being the greatest footballing nation in the world (with regards to the women\u2019s game), the club is already comprised of an assortment of high-achieving operators, such as co-founder and Academy Award-winning actress Natalie Portman, technology venture capitalist Kara Nortman, media and gaming entrepreneur Julie Uhrman, and Seven Seven Six founder and former Executive Chair of Reddit, Alexis Ohanian.<\/p>\n<p>With football being the main agenda, the club has also onboarded the expertise of former England Women\u2019s National Team forward Eniola Aluko, who will serve as Sporting Director, as well as renowned manager Freya Coombe, who will be the team\u2019s Head Coach.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
