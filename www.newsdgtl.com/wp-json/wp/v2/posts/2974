His current prediction is $45. However, he says ApeCoin will be worth $10 come 2030.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The ongoing rush or hype with NFTs greatly impact the coin\u2019s performace. Salampasis feels that crypto is overhyped at some point and it would gradually lose its value over time when the hype dies down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, Salampasis believes that now is the best time to sell ApeCoin. However, some of his co-panelists think that it\u2019s time to HODL APE. Still, a few percent say now is definitely the time to buy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Finder Co-Founder Fred Schebesta gave his forecast as well. He said APE could be valued at $20 by end of 2022, go higher at $50 by end of 2025, and finally shoot up to $100 by 2030.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/xCbCPfL3\/\" width=\"1824\" height=\"870\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC total market cap at $738.16 billion on the daily chart | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2><b>What\u2019s APE?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ApeCoin is an Ethereum-based token of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT by Yuga Labs.

ApeCoin has been soaring lately because unlike other cryptos, it has expanded to other markets like tapping on NFT and the metaverse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The possibilities and potential of crypto, NFT, and the blockchain in general are so limitless that it\u2019s impossible to make a general forecast or prediction yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>APE \u2013 Shaking Grounds In The Metaverse<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">APE is the token of the future.
