In writing this article, we prioritized in-depth research and analysis over everything else. Using Nexo, you may make a passive income with an APR of up to 16%. With that said, let\u2019s get to the good stuff: how to make money with your own <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/top-9-cryptocurrencies-in-2022\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How To Earn Passive Income On Nexo<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 1: Create An Account<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing you\u2019ll need to do on Nexo, like with any other platform, is to register an account. Because Nexo has such a basic and simple-to-use UI, this shouldn\u2019t be too difficult. First, check whether Nexo is accessible in your country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, go to the official Nexo website and click on \u201cCreate Account\u201d in the upper right corner. After that, input your information and ensure that you complete the captcha and validate your email address. Now your Nexo account should be ready. Furthermore, before proceeding, ensure that you have verified your identity.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_26319\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26319\" style=\"width: 1249px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-26319 size-full\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Creating an Account wit Nexo. \" width=\"800\" height=\"552\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/3.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-26319 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/3.png\" alt=\"Creating an Account wit Nexo. \" width=\"800\" height=\"552\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-26319\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nexo Account Interface.

You can see all of your deposit options by clicking on the \u201cAccount\u201d page and scrolling down. Then click on the one that grabs your interest. Copy the Deposit Address and take it to your preferred cryptocurrency exchange, in this case, Binance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navigate to \u201cWithdraw Crypto\u201d on your <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-exchange\/\">Binance<\/a> account, and select the asset you wish to transfer to Nexo. After that, paste the address and complete the transaction. In addition, you\u2019ll have to pay blockchain fees. As soon as your transaction is completed, you\u2019re all set!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you prefer, you can easily <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nexo.io\/buy-crypto\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">buy crypto<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> directly from Nexo with a credit or debit card, as well as via wire transfer.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_26318\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26318\" style=\"width: 1316px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-26318 size-full\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Creating an Account with Nexo. \" width=\"800\" height=\"498\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/4.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-26318 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/4.png\" alt=\"Creating an Account with Nexo. \" width=\"800\" height=\"498\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-26318\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Creating an Account with Nexo.

However, Nexo requires that 10% of your savings account be held in NEXO tokens in order to receive a maximum of 12% interest rate on your <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-stablecoins\/\">stablecoins<\/a> and a 16% interest rate on your crypto assets. Unless you meet this requirement, you will only be paid interest at the regular rate. Also, the interest rates on Nexo\u2019s Stablecoins and FiatX are some of the highest on the market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexo\u2019s high-yield interest service allows you to add or remove assets whenever you desire. In addition, it does not impose any restrictions on the size of transactions or collect any fees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexo\u2019s native token NEXO, increases interest rates by 2% for all users who choose to earn in NEXO.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexo Loyalty Program<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each member of the Nexo Loyalty program has access to several tiers of rewards according to how many NEXO Tokens they have stored in their Nexo wallets, which are bundled in their Portfolio Balance. The loyalty tiers are Base, Silver, Gold, and Platinum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the base level, you do not need to have any NEXO tokens. The higher tiers, on the other hand, demand that you have NEXO tokens. NEXO tokens must account for 1% of your balance in Silver, 5% in Gold, and 10% in Platinum. The Loyalty program is intended to assist you in both the short-term and long-term development and management of your financial assets, giving you many benefits along the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexo Cards<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Nexo\u2019s existing <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nexo.io\/borrow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instant Crypto Credit Lines<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Nexo Card lets customers make ordinary transactions on the move without having to give up their digital currencies for the sake of convenience. Users can use their virtual Nexo Card right away and then get a physical one. The virtual card works just like a real card when attached to Apple Pay or Google Pay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, Nexo provides fiat currency that may be spent and, in exchange, you offer crypto as a kind of collateral for return. All of this occurs automatically anytime you use your Nexo card. In the same way as any other card, you may use your Nexo card to buy anything you want. When you acquire your Nexo Card, you\u2019ll start earning immediate crypto benefits on each and every purchase, given out in Bitcoin (BTC)\u00a0 with up to 0.5% or NEXO Tokens up to 2%.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Should I Earn With Nexo?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexo provides several solutions for rapidly growing your portfolio while keeping your cryptocurrency safe.
