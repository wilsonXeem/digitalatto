The main one is the lack of trust in the intermediary financial institutions, which opens their use to everyone worldwide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As exchange media, from a technological standpoint, cryptocurrencies are \u2018excellent.\u2019 However, fluctuations in their value ultimately made them very risky investments rather than ideal for payment. Moreover, the main problem arises due to the small <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\">market capitalization<\/a>. In other words, the smaller the market cap, the greater the price volatility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, stablecoins do not have these issues. Below, we will explain in detail what these coins are and how they work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What Are Stablecoins?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Stablecoins are essentially an attempt to create a stable cryptocurrency. In other words, they are not subject to significant price fluctuations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The value of a stablecoin is linked to the actual asset or fiat currency. Some famous stablecoins are USD Tether (USDT), Terra USD (UST), and USD Coin (USDC). All of these coins are traded 1:1 with the US Dollar. Thus, they should keep that value regardless of any influence in the market. Such coins are great for everyday value sharing, but only a few accept them as a means of payment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Today, stablecoins are mainly used as a means of payment when exchanging other <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrencies<\/a>. Moreover, they are often used to getting out of the market when the market is uncertain. By using these coins, traders use stable cryptocurrencies to trade volatile cryptocurrencies to reduce the risk of changes in value.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How Do Stablecoins Work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As mentioned earlier, stablecoins are backed by multiple sources, including fiat currency, collateralized, and algorithmic functions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fiat-backed stablecoins <\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u2013 are referred to as IOUs since you spend your dollars (or other fiat money) to purchase them, which then you can subsequently redeem for your original currency. Unlike other cryptos, which can have rapidly fluctuating values, fiat-backed stablecoins strive for relatively modest price <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-volatility\/\">volatility<\/a>. But that is not to imply that such coins are completely risk-free \u2013 they are still new, and their risks are unknown. Therefore, you should use them with caution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crypto-backed stablecoins<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> \u2013 are backed by other cryptos. Stablecoins that are backed by other cryptos are overcollateralized to protect their stability, because the asset backing the stablecoin might be volatile. These assets are less reliable than fiat-backed stablecoins. Thus, it is crucial to monitor the performance of the underlying crypto asset behind your stablecoin. DAI is an example of this stablecoin that is linked to the US dollar and runs on the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a> network.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Algorithmic stablecoins<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> \u2013 make the most difficult stablecoins to comprehend because no asset backs them. Thus, they employ a computer algorithm to protect the coin\u2019s value from changing too much. Moreover, suppose the price of the stablecoin rises, but the cost of an algorithmic stablecoin is $1. In that case, the algorithm will automatically release additional tokens into the supply to decline the price. If it goes below $1, the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-circulating-supply-and-maximum-supply\/\">supply<\/a> will be reduced, causing the price to rise again. The number of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/token-meaning-what-is-a-cryptocurrency-token\/\">tokens<\/a> you hold will significantly increase, but they will still show the total percentage you own. Interesting, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Stablecoin Risks<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Although such coins are less volatile than other types of cryptocurrency, they still rely on emerging technologies that may have unknown bugs or vulnerabilities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Whether due to a hack or human error, the risk of losing the private keys that give you access to your cryptocurrency always exists. On the other hand, stablecoins have been plagued by regulatory uncertainty. A study published by the Biden administration in November 2021 urged for increased government monitoring of such coins. While such adjustments may result in enhanced consumer safeguards, they may also affect various coins of this kind.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Limitations<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Stablecoins have their limitations, though. Some time ago, the company behind USD Tether was involved in a scandal where they supposedly manipulated the price of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin<\/a>. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Tether scandal illustrates how a stablecoin might be used for wrongdoings. Fiat-backed stablecoins are centralized. Thus, they are managed by a single entity. This requires trust in the entity backing up its stablecoins with \u2018real\u2019 money.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fiat-backed stablecoins are also subject to all of the regulations with fiat money, risking the conversion process\u2019s efficiency and the digital asset\u2019s potential efficacy. For instance, Facebook\u2019s Libra currency offered a stablecoin backed by a portfolio of global fiat currencies, extending the coin\u2019s appeal and value.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, the project\u2019s administration ditched its multi-currency goal, separated itself from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/facebook.com\">Facebook<\/a>, and rebranded due to the regulatory backlash. The network is still working will regulators to have its stablecoin approved.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How To Buy Stablecoins?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Just like any other cryptocurrency, to buy stablecoins, you have to:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can purchase stablecoins on exchanges such as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/coinbase-review\/\">Coinbase<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/gate.io\">Gate.io<\/a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-exchange\/\">Binance<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Takeaways<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Stablecoin is essentially an attempt to create a cryptocurrency that is stable<\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The value of a stablecoin is the same as the value of the actual asset or fiat currency that it pegs itself to.<\/span><\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fiat currency, crypto-backed, and algorithmic functions usually serve as backers of stablecoins.<\/span><\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Stablecoins have their limitations, depending on the currency they are pegged to.<\/span><\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can purchase stablecoins on various exchanges<\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Most exchanges support such coins.
