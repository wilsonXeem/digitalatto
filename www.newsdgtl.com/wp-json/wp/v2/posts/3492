Is there a strong reason to prefer Nexo above its rivals? Read below to find out.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Is Nexo?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexo is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency exchange and lending platform, considered the pioneer of <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nexo.io\/borrow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">crypto-backed loans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The service aims to promote a model in which obtaining crypto loans is simple with no credit checks required.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get cash or <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-stablecoins\/\">stablecoins<\/a> loan, users need to deposit crypto assets into their Nexo <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-wallet-definition\/\">wallet<\/a>. Then, they can apply for a loan through Nexo\u2019s platform. More than 40 cryptocurrencies are supported by Nexo, including well-known ones like <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cardano-price-prediction-2021\/\">Cardano<\/a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/terra-luna-price-prediction-2022\/\">Terra<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How To Earn Interest On Nexo?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step is to deposit funds. You can do that via bank transfer or direct card payment. Stablecoins pay up to 17% (UST), while other cryptocurrencies pay up to 36% (AXS). You get an interest payment every day and interest is compounded daily. You can withdraw cash at any moment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interest rates are also affected by the duration of the time held. If you decide to lock your assets for one month or more, you can earn a higher yield.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Does Nexo Work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neco Oracle is the critical component for the majority of the platform\u2019s functionality. This is because it is in charge of the majority of its operational aspects, such as network governance, real-time asset monitoring, using data analytics to manage loan distribution, and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is Nexo Legit?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a financial company with millions of consumers and expertise in cryptocurrencies, Nexo has a solid reputation. This is proved by the <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/real-time-attest.trustexplorer.io\/nexo\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">real-time 3rd party audit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Nexo\u2019s custodial assets by Armanino. Nexo is the first company in the crypto space to have such an audit. It shows that the company\u2019s assets always exceed liabilities. Nexo works with the leading authorities in custody and compliance and offers up to $375 million insurance protection on digital assets. All this makes Nexo a trustworthy company.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Are NEXO Tokens?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexo\u2019s native cryptocurrency is the <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nexo.io\/token\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NEXO Token<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holding NEXO in your Nexo account gives you benefits determined by a tier-based Loyalty Program. Depending on your loyalty tier, you get higher interest rates and five free crypto withdrawals each month. Nexo presently has four tiers: base, silver, gold, and platinum. The loyalty tier depends on how much of your crypto portfolio is in NEXO Tokens. If it constitutes to 10% or more, you get the platinum tier with the most benefits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Makes Nexo Unique?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the mainstream adoption of crypto is still ongoing, early investors have amassed a considerable fortune. The Nexo team encourages investors, entrepreneurs, miners, and average users to benefit from this wealth. Earning interest on Nexo is very easy and automatic \u2013 meaning you don\u2019t have to move your assets to different wallets, unlike other platforms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexo intends to speed up the process of providing liquidity on digital currencies by providing instant cash access. As a result, Nexo users will be more flexible when it comes to seizing investment options and satisfying their liquidity demands.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexo eliminates credit checks, removing possible credit score difficulties. For this reason, the Nexo team agreed to eliminate all hard credit checks and solely rely on trying to secure crypto-based loans tied to the value of the customer\u2019s digital assets contained in their Nexo account. This also shortens the typical loan approval process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the Nexo platform\u2019s <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchain<\/a>-based design should ensure loan-related transactions are transparent and unchangeable. Nexo uses blockchain-based loan agreements. The blockchain technology of Nexo ensure that the legal validity of the loans it provides entails full protection. Thus, the platform is safe to use.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeaways<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexo is a cryptocurrency platform that offers a fast process of buying crypto, interest on deposits, and borrowing against your cryptocurrency.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexo aims to simplify the process of obtaining crypto loans by eliminating the need for credit checks.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has a solid security infrastructure and insurance on custodial assets.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexo\u2019s native cryptocurrency is the NEXO Token.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-nexo\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cryptocurrencies behave considerably differently from traditional currencies because of their volatility.
