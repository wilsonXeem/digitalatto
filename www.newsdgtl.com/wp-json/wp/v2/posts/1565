Plus, with Shopify for the e-commerce equivalent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The man was playing third-dimensional chess with us. Mallers titled the presentation \u201cThe King\u2019s Gambit,\u201d an alternative to the \u201cpawn to e4\u201d chess opening he usually mentions. Here\u2019s the video:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Full Jack Mallers Announcement at the Bitcoin 2022 Conference\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/dD2-T7TX2rk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Inside Strike \u2018s Announcement<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The presentation started with a brief history of payment networks, starting in 1949 with the invention of the Diner\u2019s Club card. The first revelation comes next: payment networks have not evolved or innovated in 50 years. The legacy financial system is still using this ancient technology like there\u2019s no tomorrow.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">These merchants are adopting Bitcoin for payment this year.

Strike will use the bitcoin network as payment rails to enable Lightning Network transactions in a high percentage of merchants in the US. According to Mallers, bitcoin will finally be \u201cembedded into our lives.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another interesting part of the story is Senator Cynthia Lummis\u2019 support. According to a letter she sent to Mallers, she says \u201cI am working to bring smart legislation to the digital assets space, so that innovations like this can be integrated into America\u2019s financial services industry.\u201c That\u2019s reassuring. Because chances are legacy players will fight this.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">thank you <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jackmallers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jackmallers<\/a>. you&#8217;re an incredible inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 jack\u26a1\ufe0f (@jack) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jack\/status\/1512179163825938435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 7, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The senator will speak tomorrow, on Bitcoin 2022\u2019s final day of conference.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-487780 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/BTCUSD_2022-04-08_02-01-16-460x257.png\" alt=\"BTCUSD price chart for 04\/08\/2022 - TradingView\" width=\"460\" height=\"257\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC price chart for 04\/08\/2022 on Oanda | Source: BTC\/USD on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/BTCUSD\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How Did The News Affect The Market?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The general public was expecting Strike to announce an Apple partnership that would\u2019ve made bitcoin\u2019s price pump to infinity. It didn\u2019t get it. So, bitcoin traded around the $43K range the whole day and acted unaffected in front of Jack Mallers\u2019 news. It seems like the market didn\u2019t even flinch.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jackmallers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jackmallers<\/a> just announced is going to kick off the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin<\/a> circular economy in a massive way.<\/p>\n<p>I think few understand that the inability to easily use BTC is what makes it difficult to accept as a daily driver.<\/p>\n<p>Medium of exchange is here. <br \/>Next stop, Unit of Account.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Guy Swann \u26a1\ufe0f (@TheGuySwann) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheGuySwann\/status\/1512195469874802695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 7, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">More nuanced than an Apple partnership, it will take months, maybe years to see the new\u2019s impact. On the one hand, people aren\u2019t incentivized to spend their bitcoin. As long as its price is increasing, people will want to hold the asset. On the other, this provides a non-KYC way to spend your bitcoin. A non-KYC way of paying. The Strike announcement makes bitcoin a competing Medium of Exchange and puts it into every store in the US.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Is that fact priced in?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What Does The Twitterati Think About Strike \u2018s News?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Guy Swann sums up the announcement by declaring it\u2019ll \u201ckick off the Bitcoin circular economy in a massive way. I think few understand that the inability to easily use BTC is what makes it difficult to accept as a daily driver.\u201d For his part, podcaster Anthony Pompliano said, \u201cHundreds of millions of people can now spend bitcoin or dollars across the Lightning Network instantaneously, completely for free at every major US retailer.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Strike CEO <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jackmallers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jackmallers<\/a> and Strike just announced partnerships with Shopify and other leading payment providers.<\/p>\n<p>Hundreds of millions of people can now spend bitcoin or dollars across the Lightning Network instantaneously, completely for free at every major US retailer.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Pomp \ud83c\udf2a (@APompliano) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/APompliano\/status\/1512175524004732929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 7, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a phenomenal thread, Economist Lyn Alden explains the implications. \u201cThe more places that accepted BTC at point of sale (on-chain or Lightning or otherwise), the more permissionless the whole network is.
