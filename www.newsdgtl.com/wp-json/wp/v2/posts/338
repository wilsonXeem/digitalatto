With a logo repeat and a practical, adjustable cross body strap alongside the tote handle, this NFT design is available in three block colourways, with a colour pop tag.<\/p>\n<p>The \u2018Papa Cheese Melt\u2019 and Papa Tag\u2019 NFT bags incorporate street art graffiti graphics with dance fashion styling, to spotlight the hip-hop scene from around the same time Papa Johns opened its doors in 1984.<\/p>\n<p>Professional NFT designer, Tom Hoff, comments: \u201cNFTs have exploded so quickly and yet many people are still unsure how to collect them, or believe that they come with big price tags. It\u2019s great to see a brand like Papa Johns helping to make NFTs more mainstream and that two of my designs will allow people worldwide to enjoy them in the metaverse.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The NFT Hot Bags are the second ironic fashion collection from Papa Johns, who last year took one of the world\u2019s favourite cheeses \u2013 Cheddar \u2013 and elevated it to fashion status with its own streetwear collection, sold via the international fashion marketplace Depop.<\/p>\n<p>A limited-edition number of real-world hot bags will also be sold on Depop at www.depop.com\/nfthotbag (live 07.03) with one also available to win on the NFT microsite by one person who redeems an NFT between 1 March \u2013 12 April 2022.<\/p>\n<p>The NFT bags will be launched on several drop dates throughout early March and the total number of 19,840 is inspired by the date that Papa Johns was founded in 1984.<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p><script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n!function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s){if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?\nn.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;\nn.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;\nt.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window,\ndocument,'script','https:\/\/connect.facebook.net\/en_US\/fbevents.js');\n<\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.the-blockchain.com\/2022\/03\/07\/papa-johns-helps-take-nfts-mainstream\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Papa Johns, today, launches its first collection of cool and collectable NFTs, known as non-fungible tokens, as part of the metaverse\u2019s biggest ever FREE NFT giveaway in the UK.
