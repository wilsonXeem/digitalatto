The public opening comes a lot sooner than expected, as the company initially posited that it would take weeks to months for the platform\u2019s democratization to take place.<\/p>\n<p>For now, it remains unclear as to why or how developments moved quicker than planned, with a company spokesperson simply stating that the product is now ready for heavier traffic volumes. With this in mind, and with its pre-existing 89 million user base at its disposal, the crypto exchange hopes that an<strong> influx of new users<\/strong> will allow it to conduct larger volumes of tests, in order to make more informed decisions when adding or enhancing features on the platform.<\/p>\n<p>When addressing the public opening in a statement, the company said: <i>\u201cCoinbase believes NFTs are here to stay, and the Coinbase marketplace is about much more than just buying and selling. Coinbase is focused on cultivating a community and is excited to be opening the beta up for more people to enjoy the experience they have created\u201d.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>If circulating rumours appear to be correct, Coinbase will have around <strong>one month to refine the platform<\/strong>, as many have penned in June 2022 as its time of full launch.
