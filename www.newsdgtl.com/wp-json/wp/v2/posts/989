At the same time, the token acts as a payment mechanism for users that want to drop proofs via Baseledger transactions.<\/p>\n<p>This aforementioned model has the potential to support the distinction between and properly address both the enterprise audience (interested in Software-as-a-Service with a classic fiat payment model) and the cryptocurrency audience (interested in holding and staking UBT and participating in rewards).<\/p>\n<p>Being an enterprise-oriented blockchain network, Baseledger is a prime utility and use case for the token. Plus, there is already a set of products and services powered by UBT within Unibright\u2019s product offerings.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Baseledger is a perfect extension of these offerings. By combining them and making UBT the token to fuel Baseledger, UBT is not only an \u201cinput\u201d payment token but also an \u201coutput\u201d reward token, which makes the token flow complete.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u201cIt has been great work by all Unibright team members and all participants in the ever growing Baseledger ecosystem.
