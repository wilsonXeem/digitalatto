Today I introduce you to the wonderful world of<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bkhan___\"> Bushra Khan<\/a>, an incredible artist exploring the landscapes of her imagination through art.<\/p>\n<p>Bushra\u2019s dreamy and sublime artworks take you on a surreal journey of colours, thoughts, patterns, and pure expression. Bushra has been an artist for a long time, but was inspired to join the NFT space through a friend. So let\u2019s dive in to find out more about how her NFT journey started, her views on CryptoArt, and what she\u2019s working on!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How did you find out about the NFT space, and what attracted you to create your own NFTs?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I found out about the NFT space through my friend Waheed on Instagram, also known as All Smilesss. I was interested in creating my own NFTs because I admired how people would connect to art. It reminded me of being in art class where I\u2019d explain the reasons behind my artistic decisions. I felt like the NFT space created a way for me to connect with others who I had lost a connection to during Covid. It was also a connection behind the art world, I have made some of my closest friends through NFTs.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How often do you create?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I create art everyday. The way I speak, dress, think and exist is its own art form. Bushra Khan is a work of art. As for pieces of art, I try to create at least one or two a month. Everything is so fast paced in the NFT space and I often find myself rushing but I try to remember that great art takes time \u2013 and my art will be nothing short of greatness.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-36154 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/khan3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"916\" height=\"862\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What is your creative process?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Each piece has its own process. Some start with a poem that helps me visualize my state of mind. Other times, I can visualize a feeling I\u2019ve been dwelling on and then try to make it tangible. One thing is for sure, I always see how I want a piece to look in my head before I put it on a canvas.<\/p>\n<p>It is my journey as an artist to successfully capture the vision that exists in my mind. I will forever spend my time trying to communicate the world that exists within me.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-36156 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/khan5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"814\" height=\"908\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Are there any CryptoArtists you would love to collaborate with?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I would love to collaborate with Milan, also known as Mediolanum666. I love his style. I have never seen anything like it. I also enjoy the meaning he puts behind his pieces. I can tell he really pays attention to the detail our eyes can dissect as well as the details that exist beyond a canvas.<\/p>\n<p>I would also love to collab with Waheed. Both of us have grown so much as humans and artists, I truly believe if we were to intertwine our imagination we would change the art world.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What do you think the future of CryptoArt will look like?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I truly think the possibilities are endless, but to me \u201cCryptoArt\u201d is not a real thing. We are all making art, we just happen to have it on a platform that uses crypto. On a smaller scale, I think this new opportunity in art will create a new wave of artists that are more hands on.<\/p>\n<p>Artists can control who can enjoy their art on a huge scale, as well as how to profit on their own art without a middle man. We are the new creators, one where we are in control and the world is our audience.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-36155 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/khan4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1014\" height=\"875\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What are you currently working on?<br \/><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I am working on a new collection! I want to connect back to making physical art. This collection will consist of canvas paintings that my collectors have the opportunity to claim alongside the NFT. I will also send out each piece with a letter explaining the painting\u2019s meaning and origin.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier I spoke about my process, the final part of my process is prepping my audience. I am the only person who can do my arts story justice, and with these paintings, only my collectors will know the whole truth. There will be hundreds of works in this collection and I will work on it for the rest of my life.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-36153 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/khan2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"826\" height=\"844\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Where can collectors find your work?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I have a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/linktr.ee\/bkhan___\">link in the bio<\/a> of all of my socials! It has the link to my NFTs that are all on Foundation, as well as a link to my prints. I also have my Instagram there if people want to see my work pre-NFTs.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
