Bitcoiner <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Dennis_Porter_\/status\/1496581783869018112\">Dennis Porter<\/a> made this point in a recent tweet, saying:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cApparently the EU wants to ban #Bitcoin mining because they really don\u2019t want the next 100 years of energy innovation to happen there.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>However, the issue highlights the multifaceted, sometimes conflicting, objectives faced by regulators. After all, regardless of where you stand on Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining, there\u2019s little doubt it has an impact on energy resources.<\/p>\n<h2>Bitcoin mining remains a source of controversy<\/h2>\n<p>There are two issues to consider when it comes to Bitcoin mining: the energy source and the level of consumption.<\/p>\n<p>As alleged by <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-05-12\/musk-says-tesla-suspending-bitcoin-purchases-citing-energy-use?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=business\">Elon Musk<\/a> last May, the majority source for miners comes from highly polluting fossil fuels. Then again, this is disputed by some researchers who say the Bitcoin network is powered by up to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2021\/09\/03\/climate\/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html\">75%<\/a> renewable sources.<\/p>\n<p>Regarding consumption, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/ccaf.io\/cbeci\/index\">Cambridge University<\/a> estimates Bitcoin consumes 131.26 TWh of electricity over a year. For perspective, this is more than the country of Ukraine, which has a population of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.worldometers.info\/world-population\/ukraine-population\/\">43 million<\/a> (124.5 TWh p\/a) but less than Egypt, at 149.1 TWh p\/a.<\/p>\n<p>Critics liken Bitcoin to a ravenous monster in that the bigger it gets, the more electricity it will consume. They foresee a time when blackouts occur as electricity infrastructures struggle to cope with demand. For that reason, curbs on PoW mining are necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Power blackouts due to competing demands have already happened in <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/05\/26\/iran-bans-bitcoin-mining-as-its-cities-suffer-blackouts.html\">Iran<\/a>, and more recently, in <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-01-25\/kazakhstan-unplugged-bitcoin-miners-before-blackout-hit-region\">Kazakhstan<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>MicroStrategy CEO <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/saylor\/status\/1392920275184988161\">Michael Saylor<\/a> points out the relationship isn\u2019t as linear as people think. In response to the controversy triggered by Musk, he countered by saying energy efficiency improves as the network scales.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The estimated electricity consumption per <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/Lj4SMIkLS8\">https:\/\/t.co\/Lj4SMIkLS8<\/a> YTD increased 40% during the same period that the network grew 100% in assets, meaning that energy efficiency dramatically improved during this time period. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin<\/a> is becoming less energy intensive as it scales.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/saylor\/status\/1392920275184988161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2021<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>However, Saylor\u2019s point didn\u2019t address raw consumption, which will still increase as the network grows.
