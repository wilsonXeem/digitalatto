It all started on April 2nd, when Elon Musk <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1113009339743100929?s=20&amp;t=t9WeG16fX2zElKFMyUqsmQ\">tweeted<\/a> \u201cDogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d In the weeks that followed, Dogecoin \u2013 cryptocurrency\u2019s original meme \u2013 skyrocketed from a meager $0.05 to a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nomics.com\/assets\/doge-dogecoin\/history\/4\">high<\/a> of $0.75 on May 7th. That means a DOGE holder who had $100 of Dogecoin on April 2nd would have had $1500 less than a month later.<\/p>\n<p>With the Tesla CEO incorporating DOGE into its accepted payments for merchandise sales and supercharging stations and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/04\/10\/elon-musk-on-changes-to-twitter-blue-says-dogecoin-should-be-accepted.html\">suggesting<\/a> that people who subscribe to Twitter Blue should be able to pay with Dogecoin, DOGE itself (approximately $0.08 at the time of writing) still has massive upside potential. But many feel as though they\u2019ve missed out on the asset\u2019s heyday. They\u2019re looking for the next 10,000x that only comes from early adoption. These five dog-themed coins have the potential to do just that.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/babydoge.com\/\">Baby Doge<\/a> ($BABYDOGE) is a deflationary token designed to become more scarce over time. They charge a 5% fee for each sale of the asset and redistribute that fee to Baby Doge Coin holders \u2013 meaning the longer you hold, the more you can earn. It\u2019s worth noting that Musk himself <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.analyticsinsight.net\/baby-doge-elon-musk-tweets-on-dogecoin-spinoff-new-cryptocurrency\/#:~:text=He%20tweeted%2C%20%E2%80%9CBaby%20Doge%2C,into%20Baby%20Doge%20so%20soon.\">tweeted<\/a> about Baby Doge on July 1st 2021. Currently, Baby Doge sits at $263 million market cap.<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dogelonmars.com\/\">Dogelon Mars<\/a> ($ELON) is a dog-themed project that seeks to outpace Dogecoin\u2019s success. As the website says, \u201cI am Dogelon. Dogelon Mars. Join me and together we will reach the stars.\u201d The page refers to Musk\u2019s vision of colonizing Mars \u2013 though the controversial billionaire has yet to mention the asset. ELON is currently ranked #126 on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/dogelon\/\">CoinMarketCap<\/a> with a market cap of $267 million.<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/minidoge.finance\/\">Mini Doge<\/a> ($MINIDOGE) started as a deflationary meme coin, but it\u2019s since evolved into a Web 3 ecosystem complete with a play-to-earn adventure game that allows holders to earn NFTs and more tokens as they go. Mini Doge has a market cap of only $2.3 million.<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/pulsedoge.win\/\">Pulse Doge Win<\/a> ($PULSEDOGE) is a community meme token that was built on Binance Smart Chain with the intent of bringing adoption to PulseChain \u2013 a new layer 1 blockchain set to launch later this year. The website claims that those who hold PulseDoge on BSC at the time of PulseChain\u2019s launch will receive an equal 1:1 airdrop on PulseChain. This means that if you buy the token now, you\u2019ll get double for your money. PulseDoge has a $7.5 million market cap.<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dogechain-lab.github.io\/landing-page\/app.html\">Dogechain<\/a> ($DC) is an up-and-coming layer-1 blockchain designed to give DOGE more DeFi utility. For a limited amount of time, $DOGE holders will be able to freeclaim $DC tokens when they bridge their DOGE over from centralized exchanges or other chains. Staking bridged $DOGE will yield $DC tokens over time, while staking $DC will allow users to earn yield, prizes, rewards, and voting rights on the Doge DAO. This means that buying $DOGE now could yield exponential gains when $DC launches. Additionally, the DogeChain team has been conducting a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DogechainFamily\">grand-a-day giveaway<\/a> for the entire month of May. There are still a few days left to get involved.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>2021\u2019s epic bull run is over, but there will be another bull market, and people love their dogs. Dog-themed projects will continue to dominate the memecoin space for the foreseeable future.
