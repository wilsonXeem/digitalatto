Many big brands like Kohl\u2019s, Walmart and Home Depot chose to close their stores on Thanksgiving Day, following an #OptOutside movement <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/simonmainwaring\/2017\/01\/10\/how-rei-launched-and-built-a-movement-far-larger-than-the-brand-itself\/?sh=2ade14626761\">pioneered by REI<\/a>. And even though brick-and-mortar stores saw 66 million customers on Black Friday, in-store sales dropped to a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/2020\/11\/30\/black-friday-store-traffic-hits-15-year-lows\/\">15-year low<\/a>. Meanwhile, online shopping <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/11\/29\/shopify-merchants-cyber-monday-sales-have-already-topped-2020-figures-president.html\">continued to grow<\/a>, with some merchants increasing their Black Friday online sales 22% from last year.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"ibm-h2\">Cyber Monday grew\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>Cyber Monday emerged from the trend of employees going back to the office after Thanksgiving break and shopping online with faster internet speeds than their home networks. Now, with fast internet available everywhere and millions still working from home, Cyber Monday has evolved into Cyber Week, and is fast becoming an even more extended Cyber November. This year, ongoing fear of missing out on discounted products due to anticipated inventory shortages drove consumers to start holiday shopping earlier than usual. October saw a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/11\/16\/retail-sales-rise-faster-than-expected-in-october-even-as-inflation-pushes-prices-higher.html\">10.2% increase in online sales<\/a> and November followed suit with a 9% increase. Without doorbuster deals and with limited supplies propping up prices, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.practicalecommerce.com\/sales-report-2021-thanksgiving-day-black-friday-cyber-monday\">average prices were 11% higher<\/a> than 2020.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"ibm-h2\">While customers expected faster\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>The pandemic has changed how shoppers buy and receive goods. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/account\/reg\/us-en\/signup?formid=urx-51220\">IHL\u2019s 2021 Order Management Market Research Study<\/a> calls out a 4.5x acceleration in the timetable to deploy new customer journeys: buy online pickup-in-store (BOPIS), same-day delivery, and curbside pick-up. These are now widespread, permanently adopted fixtures for retail. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/blogs.idc.com\/2021\/06\/30\/kickin-it-curbside-enabling-the-retail-workforce-for-omnichannel-fulfillment\/\">IDC reports<\/a> 58.9% of consumers said they will likely select another retailer if BOPIS is not offered. Merchants quickly unified their online storefronts with their brick-and-mortar stores, and they can now service customers with more granular information on product availability, location and shipping fees. Companies are developing innovative models to reach customers, like fulfilling from well-stocked stores serving as mini-distribution centers, or collaborating with their partners in stockless drop-shipping, as we saw earlier this year with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/sudhirbalebail_very-launches-stockless-fulfilment-with-adidas-activity-6858868901158154240-gaut\">The Very Group partnering with Adidas and Rebook<\/a> for D2C distribution.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"ibm-h2\">And retailers delivered with innovative ideas<\/h2>\n<p>Walmart has been an early adopter of new digital initiatives, testing 15 online shopping events this year, including a collaboration with Twitter for their first shoppable livestream during Cyber Week.
