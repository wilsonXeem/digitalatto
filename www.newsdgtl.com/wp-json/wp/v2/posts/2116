It even traded above the $41,000 level, but failed to clear the $41,500 resistance zone.<\/p>\n<p>A high is formed near $41,334 and the price is now correcting gains. It is testing the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $38,570 swing low to $41,334 high.

The main resistance is still near the $41,500 zone. To start a strong upward move, the price must clear the $41,500 zone. In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise towards the $42,500 resistance zone. Any more gains could set the pace for a move towards the $43,200 level.<\/p>\n<h2>Fresh Decline in BTC?<\/h2>\n<p>If bitcoin fails to clear the $41,500 resistance zone, it could start another decline. An immediate support on the downside is near the $40,250 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.<\/p>\n<p>The next major support is seen near the $39,950 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $38,570 swing low to $41,334 high. A downside break below the $39,950 support zone could push the price towards the $39,000 level.<\/p>\n<p>Technical indicators:<\/p>\n<p>Hourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.<\/p>\n<p>Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC\/USD is now above the 50 level.<\/p>\n<p>Major Support Levels \u2013 $40,250, followed by $39,950.<\/p>\n<p>Major Resistance Levels \u2013 $41,350, $41,500 and $42,500.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/bitcoin-recovers-losses-41-5k\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bitcoin extended decline below the $39,000 level against the US Dollar.
