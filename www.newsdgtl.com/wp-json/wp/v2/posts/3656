The ecosystem compromises a unique combination of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/smart-contracts\/\">smart contract<\/a> functionality with a very safe and secure system of trading and transaction without any involvement of mediators. Its Hyperblocks subsidiary runs the validators that help in its security. The network uses an asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance (aBFT) consensus model to validate transactions. Cosmos hub also resides inside Cosmos Hub, and Cosmos is a token to it. On the other hand, ATOM tokens are used for security purposes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary focus of Cosmos is its programmability, and its center stage is the blockchain algorithm. Hence, it allows the benefit through a digital money perspective to users and also provides marketplace transactions, such as financial apps, games, and other services, which can be built on the platform. Furthermore, through its global expansion, it provides a network of a huge number of users and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/dapp-meaning-what-are-dapps\/\">dApps<\/a> (decentralized applications) and ongoing developments and upgrades.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmos (ATOM) Fundamental Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ATOM users can send and receive payment in any form of currency of their own choice using smart contracts, as ATOM has the ability to convert different types and chains of crypto assets. Its multifunctional characteristics allow diverse practical applications of existing security apps for data exchange and transactions. It provides complete accessibility in multiple layer solutions and supports the working of a number of application platforms on itself for a comfortable experience. Along with a standardized mechanism of scalability, ATOM has a key feature of trading different kinds of tokens through decentralized exchanges. The platform\u2019s features, made especially for mobile applications and developers kits, are very supportive and friendly to users and have an independent algorithm. It also has the capacity for a plethora to be posted on ATOM\u2019s sidechain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developers of Cosmos wanted to build a new generation of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchain<\/a> technology, and users can join it as a fast emerging token economy that is built on a stable and secure foundation. Users can create a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-decentralized-finance\/\">decentralized finance<\/a> application, exchange, or marketplace that can allow anyone to buy, sell, invest, and lend without a bank account. The platform also empowers the community in organizing and distributing resources among its members. It also gives them the right to vote for beneficial governance decisions. Users can even make in-game assets that would be owned by the players and would always be available to them. The lasting values in games can be transferred to another game or even to the real world by choice of the gamer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Cosmos Works<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the presence of thousands of cryptocurrencies, there lacks a source of communication among them. That is why Cosmos is considered one of the best platforms for fixing this problem and letting the blockchains connect. Each blockchain is called a \u2018zone\u2019 in this blockchain. An inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol connects these zones or blockchains together. Blockchains built on the basis of Cosmos retain their independence and interact with each other, all because of the combined deployment of both Tendermint\u2019s Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus protocol and the IBC protocol. Tendermint, being a software company, contributes to the Cosmos network from the core. As a result, the network of Cosmos is able to launch high throughput need services, including decentralized content economy and open marketplaces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmos provides the developers with prebuilt modules to facilitate quick deployment of new blockchains that are customizable for specific use cases. Furthermore, Cosmos uses a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/pos-meaning-in-crypto-what-is-proof-of-stake\/\">proof-of-stake<\/a> mechanism to secure the blockchain in an eco-friendly way. Hence, no one is able to spend money that does not belong to themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokenomics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmos network has many hubs, and a PoS blockchain called Cosmos Hub consists of one of these hubs. ATOM is its native <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-tokenomics\/\">token<\/a> that is required by any validator in the PoS consensus mechanism to take part in the validation process. So, the token\u2019s fundamental purpose is to provide sustenance and security to the Cosmos Hub network. Other major purposes include spam prevention, staking, and governance. The token has a key role in the functions of Cosmos. It makes the network more resilient and robust. The holder can not only vote using it but can also allocate their right to vote for earning rewards. With the new interchain security feature, the token will also be able to earn more staking rewards by securing several chains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users can set the next-generation decentralized exchange and swap digital assets across chains.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the ATOM token is used as a fee during transactions, the more energy is used during transactions, and the more will be the transaction fee. Hence the network fee prevents wasteful network use and saves from spamming. The staking process increases the overall security of the network while providing an opportunity for users to earn rewards. As the cost of attacking the network is directly proportional to the number of collateralized ATOM tokens, the network security is further increased. Additionally, the holders of ATOM tokens have the right to vote for changes and development in the protocol on proposals with their staked ATOMs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmos Accomplishments<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmos has not published a new roadmap yet, but its initial plans have been fulfilled till now. First of all, Jae Kwon and Ethan Buchman, the cofounders of Tendermint, released a whitepaper \u201cCosmos: A Network of Distributed Ledgers\u201d in 2016. They introduced a new protocol for connecting blockchains. They launched the Interchain Foundation later that year to shepherd the development of Cosmos. On its initial offering (ICO), Cosmos raised $16 million in 2017. Cosmos launched the project\u2019s initial version and the Cosmos Hub, which was the first blockchain working on the protocol, in 2019. Kwon, along with another early contributor Zaki Manian after going through a highly publicized feud, led the Cosmos\u2019 founding team members to go their separate ways with three companies. Cosmos activated IBC by launching the Stargate upgrade. It was a critical project made for the first time to connect hundreds of Cosmos\u2019 blockchains.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmos (ATOM) Price Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cosmos is trading at a price of $9 presently at a trading volume of $1.3 billion million. It has a market capitalization of more than $2.6 billion. With a circulating supply of more than $286 million tokens, The CoinMarketCap currently ranks it as #30.
