Numerous causes, including the Federal Reserve&#8217;s latest policy changes, are assumed to be driving the bearish attitudes in the market. Nevertheless, early on Tuesday on Twitter, Cuban mentioned a present &#8220;imitation phase&#8221; in crypto\/blockchain, rather than actual progress, saying that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201ccrypto is going through the lull that the internet went through.\u201d<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Crypto is going through the lull that the internet went through.
