Amongst these tokens is Big Data Protocol (BDP), Pastry said. This project managed to attract over $6 billion in total value locked (TVL) and generate a lot of hype.<\/p>\n<p>This allowed BDP whales to \u201cdump\u201d their tokens on retail investors, as discovered by Igor Igamberdiev, The Block\u2019s director of research. As Pastry noted:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These addresses farmed massive amounts of $BDP and dumped it on LPs in BDP\u2019s Pool2 which rewarded users with $bAlpha for providing liquidity to BDP\/ETH. It was exit liquidity for whales. The BDP token feel from $13 to $3, while bAlpha dumped from $25k to $5k.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Second on the list is BOTTO which, the pseudonym user said, has a market cap of around $4 million. Therefore, could see high volatility and an illiquid market cap to the detriment of its potential traders. Pastry asked the following about Coinbase\u2019s prospects:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Really, Coinbase? Are you not aware of the risks you expose thousands of traders to\u00a0 by listing a project that is so small and illiquid? Coinbase does $327 BILLION in quarterly trading volume, yet they want to list a project with a market cap of $4m. Irresponsible.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The same goes for $KROMATIK another of Coinbase\u2019s potential crypto to add to its platform. The token has a small market of under $10 million. Pastry questioned the rise in its trading volume just days before Coinbase\u2019s announcement.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_488091\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-488091\" style=\"width: 859px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-488091 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Crypto-Coinbase.png\" alt=\"Crypto Coinbase\" width=\"859\" height=\"661\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-488091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: PastryETH via Twitter<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Is Coinbase Purposely Listing \u201cCrypto Scams\u201d?<\/h2>\n<p>MONA and PMON made the list. The former has a small market cap with a daily trading volume of around $10,000 which, Pastry emphasized, could be hurtful for the users.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, PMON is a project dubbed \u201cone of the largest marketing failures this bull-run, by Zachxbt a popular investigator. Similar to BDP, this token was used by insiders to dump on retail investors, according to Pastry.<\/p>\n<p>On the list, there was also RAC a token with a $0 trading volume, and Student Coin (STC) a project with a similar trading volume. The list is comprised of mostly unknown crypto, according to the pseudonym user, with high probabilities of hurting the users due to low trading volume or illiquid markets.<\/p>\n<p>Responding to the question of whether the exchange is listing out of \u201cignorance or malice\u201d, Pastry said, he referred to evidence of a potential Coinbase insider purchasing large amounts of the tokens before the listing announcements.
