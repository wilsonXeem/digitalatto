However, neither channel offers much transparency behind the reasoning around the move, which has largely been credited by speculators to be the result of increased SEC scrutiny.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1\/ <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CelsiusNetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CelsiusNetwork<\/a> is launching a Custody solution for our US users and introducing some changes to our services.

What we do know is that these changes were unlikely to be made at the behest of Celsius on their own, as the end result is more barriers to entry for retail consumers. It\u2019s unclear the specific needs to be an accreditted investor on the Celsius platform. The company utilizes VerifyInvestor.com, which typically charges $70 per individual for a verification application. While Celsius is apparently eating the cost of verification, will small crypto users be verified? Large questions loom, and it\u2019s likely that many will elect not to even attempt verification. The platform will roll-out it\u2019s \u2018Custody\u2019 feature as it\u2019s replacement for swapping, borrowing, and transferring tokens. However, the \u2018Earn\u2019 feature was undoubtedly a major drive for Celsius\u2019 existing business.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-488003 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screen-Shot-2022-04-12-at-5.12.16-PM-460x241.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"901\" height=\"470\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Celsius offers a native platform token to earn boosted rewards, but to date has been unable to offer the token to U.S. users.
