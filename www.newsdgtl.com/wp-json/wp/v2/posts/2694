The eight episode series, which has been created by Audio Up\u2019s Chief Creative Officer Jimmy Jellinek, will be called \u2018Moon Station Six\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Described as \u2018Oz meets 2001: A Space Odyssey,\u2019 the series will take listeners on the journey of a falsely convicted android bounty hunter, who is serving time in an experimental jail in the outer edges of the Star Atlas universe for a murder he did not commit. Intuitively, <strong>Moon Station Six<\/strong> will become part of the greater Star Atlas lore, meaning listeners can expect appearances and cameos from their favourite characters throughout the series.<\/p>\n<p>To explicitly incorporate blockchain technology into the endeavour, the series will launch a unique soundtrack with corresponding NFT drops. Here, listeners will be able to unlock additional elements of the Moon Station Six tale, as well as its accompanying original music and imagery.<\/p>\n<p>When speaking on the partnership, Pablo Quiroga, co-founder of<strong> Star Atlas<\/strong>, added that Moon Station Six is one of many ways in which the metaverse game is diversifying its content.<\/p>\n<p><i>\u201cAfter working with Jared and his team on this unique podcast experience over the last few months, I feel we\u2019ve discovered a future where web3 content creation will become multimedia experience and an integral part of the industry. Our vision of Star Atlas has always been one where users experience content in a variety of ways, from our upcoming 3D Ship Showroom to our web-based browser experience. We lead the industry in this category, and this is just the beginning with Audio Up,\u201d\u00a0<\/i>commented Quiroga.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
