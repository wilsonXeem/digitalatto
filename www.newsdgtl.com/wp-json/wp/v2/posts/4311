At that time, the protocol processed less than $10 billion in cumulative trading volume.<\/p>\n<p>The $1 trillion milestone was reached in less than a year as Uniswap went processing around $250 billion in cumulative trading volume to $750 trillion in March 2022. The metric has been on the rise despite the current downtrend across global markets.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_491250\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-491250\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-491250\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Uniswap-UNI-UNIUSDT-Ethereum-460x238.jpg\" alt=\"Uniswap UNI UNIUSDT Ethereum\" width=\"460\" height=\"238\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-491250\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Uniswap Labs via Twitter<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The team behind Uniswap <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Uniswap\/status\/1529102980296867842?s=20&amp;t=AI-Ijfvtn3zwPKITCc7SAQ\">stated<\/a> the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s been one hell of a ride. As of today, the Uniswap Protocol has passed a lifetime cumulative trading volume of $1 Trillion (\u2026). We couldn\u2019t have reached this milestone without the Uniswap community that continues to build alongside us. Here\u2019s to the next Trillion.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Additional data provided by the team behind the protocol suggest Uniswap\u2019s popularity has been increasing along with its trading volume. The DEX\u2019s market share surpassed 50% in August 2020 and has reached over 60% since that time.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the number of Uniswap Users recently hit almost 4 million. In January 2021, the metric stood at less than 1 million users. This represents a 4x increase in a little over a year. The inventor of Uniswap, Hayden Adams, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/haydenzadams\/status\/1529105703427878912\">added<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>$1 trillion all-time volume. I don\u2019t tweet milestones as often these days, but four commas blows my mind. Never expected Uniswap to grow the way that it has. Thanks to everyone who has been along for the ride.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>What\u2019s Behind This Ethereum DEX Success?<\/h2>\n<p>There are three potential events that have resulted in Uniswap\u2019s increase in market share and popularity. The first in the deployment of its second iteration, Uniswap v2 introduced new features and functionalities replicated across the entire DeFi sector.<\/p>\n<p>The second is the launch of its governance token, UNI. The token rolled out around September 2020, when Uniswap\u2019s fundamental began their upwards ascend, and it was airdropped to all users that ever interacted with the protocol.<\/p>\n<p>The event marked an inflection point in the adoption of DeFi protocols. The next year, the sector boomed with the introduction of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) into the mainstream and more people onboarding it.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_491248\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-491248\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-491248 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Uniswap-UNI-UNIUSDT-Ethereum-ETH-ETHUSD-460x239.jpg\" alt=\"Uniswap UNI UNIUSDT Ethereum ETH ETHUSD\" width=\"460\" height=\"239\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-491248\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Uniswap Labs via Twitter<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The third event was the launch of DEX\u2019s third iteration, Uniswap v3. This version offered more rewards to users with active investment strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Today, most blockchain networks can\u2019t exist without a DeFi sector and their own version of Uniswap. Despite its popularity, the DEX and other protocols have been affected by the current downside price action across large cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<p>Data from Token Terminal suggests Uniswap peaked in September 2021 when its total value locked (TVL) was close to $10 billion and its trading volume followed. Ever since then, this metric has been in a downtrend and currently appears to be consolidating.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/bitcoin-price-stuck-in-range-30k\/\">TA: Bitcoin Price Stuck In Key Range, Why Dips Might Be Limited<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At the time of writing, UNI\u2019s price stands at $5.57 with a 5.5% loss in the last 24-hours.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_491249\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-491249\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-491249 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Uniswap-UNI-UNIUSDT-860x376.png\" alt=\"Uniswap UNI UNIUSDT\" width=\"860\" height=\"376\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-491249\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">UNI trends to the downside on the 4-hour chart.
