The field is new and experimental so <strong>nobody can claim to have definitive solutions to this problem.<\/strong> Still finding new ways of approaching and structuring in-game economics could lead to better outcomes in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Axie Infinity\u2019s Smooth Love Potion ($SLP) has been steadily losing its value since the beginning of 2022. (<\/span><\/i><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/smooth-love-potion\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h4><b>Why Are So Many P2E Gaming Currencies Rapidly Losing Their Value?\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s no secret that traditional gaming communities have taken issue with P2E gaming. And while there are <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gameshub.com\/news\/opinions-analysis\/play-to-earn-video-games-11414\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">several different reasons<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for this, part of the issue is <\/span><b>high starting costs<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Players have to obtain expensive NFTs before they can start participating \u2013 for instance, the absolute rock-bottom cost of the three Axies that you\u2019ll need to start playing Axie Infinity was <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/stealthoptional.com\/how-to\/axie-infinity-cost\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$84<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 but it can cost a lot more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These costs are on the expensive side, even for gamers in the Global North. But for P2E players in the Global South \u2013 who are much more likely to rely on gaming income to pay for essential expenses \u2013 these costs are simply prohibitive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, to address these high starting costs, games and their communities created rental systems \u2013 or <\/span><b>scholarships<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as they are known. These enabled experienced players who had abundant gaming NFTs to lend them out to new players who had none \u2013 in exchange, for a share of their in-game earnings. This has been revolutionary for players in the developing world, who often rely on their in-game earnings to make ends meet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the most part, this system worked. Renting NFTs out to new players seemed like a win-win: players who were previously priced out of a gaming ecosystem gained a point of entry, and players who had NFTs to spare got a new source of income.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, the balance of revenue between NFT owners and renters seems to have resulted in virtually<\/span><b> infinite selling pressure.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<h4><b>NFT Rental Systems Can Create Unsustainable Economics for Fungible Gaming Tokens<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before diving in, I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge just how novel all of this is. The whole P2E gaming space is practically brand new \u2013 and as such, there are no real authorities on the space. Rather, the Pegaxy team and I are testing how to find the best outcomes fully aware that we need to be agile as the gaming dynamics evolve. All creators in the P2E space are<strong> pioneering a completely new front<\/strong>, and need to be prepared to iterate constantly as this technology develops. What I can offer, however, is the perspective we\u2019ve developed using the data that we have.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also important to note that the concept of NFT rental doesn\u2019t cause inflation in and of itself. Rather, selling pressure comes from the way that these rental systems interact with other aspects of the in-game economy, as well as players\u2019 individual lives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, let\u2019s look at the way that revenue is typically distributed between NFT lenders and renters. Often, lenders receive 30% of the in-game currency that renters earn while they\u2019re using borrowed NFTs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again \u2013 this revenue-sharing model is not an issue in and of itself. However, because many NFTs renters rely on their in-game earnings to survive in the physical world,<strong> they exchange their in-game earnings for fiat currency shortly after they receive them.<\/strong> Effectively, this means that 70% of in-game currency generated each day is sold straight away.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This selling pressure<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is what leads to inflation. And left unchecked, the problem can worsen as more players participate.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>How to Fix Broken Gamenomics<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, there are several solutions to this problem. And looking forward, it is possible to fix these types of broken gamenomics for the future \u2013 if not retroactively.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One method of reducing inflation is to reverse the <\/span><b>revenue sharing models <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employed by NFT rental systems \u2013 so that, for example, lenders would receive 70% of profits, while renters would get 30%. Practically, this would mean that a smaller number of tokens would be sold each day in exchange for fiat currency.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any transition to this practice needs to be managed carefully to avoid users who depend on P2E earnings\u00a0 suddenly facing a drop in their income. The resulting reduction in inflation should balance out so that the token recovers value and keeps users\u2019 income whole.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An additional anti-inflation solution is to introduce a token burning mechanism into a game\u2019s economy. Using these methods, games can gradually increase the value of their tokens without shocking the system. And this approach is receiving some advocates: Axie Infinity\u2019s <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/play2moon.com\/burning-axies-and-slp-will-it-help-axie-infinity-balance-tokenomics\/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=burning-axies-and-slp-will-it-help-axie-infinity-balance-tokenomics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recently-introduced token burner<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> destroys both $SLP and Axies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another method of avoiding the inflationary pressure introduced by NFT rental systems is by eliminating the need for these systems in the first place. For instance, Pegaxy has no starting costs for users \u2013 people can play the game with zero starting capital, and use their earnings to purchase their own gaming NFTs overtime.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Building a Culture of Solutions<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The beauty of P2E gaming is innovation.<\/strong> Blockchain game developers have created systems that value people\u2019s time, and compensate them for spending it accordingly. But the fact that the field is so new also means that there are few precedents. Being a creator in this space can feel like trailblazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Problems in P2E gaming economies can\u2019t always be foreseen. But moving forward, new games can learn from the actions of P2E games past and present \u2013 we are a community that learns from each other. And together, we can learn how to build better gaming economies for the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
