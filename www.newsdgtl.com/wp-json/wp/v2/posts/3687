This was announced by the chairperson of the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.iosco.org\/\">International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)<\/a>, Ashley Alder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In a statement published by Reuters on the 12th of May, Alder noted some key points regarding the crypto regulations. He says that the fundamental goal of the organization is to establish a uniform crypto regulation framework. This comes as a result of the industry\u2019s tremendous expansion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In addition, Alder mentioned three main domains where they think that a significant authority change is required. These areas cover digital assets, Covid-19, and climate change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Following his statement, he calls the three C\u2019s (COVID, climate, and crypto) quite significant. According to Alder, this <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">crypto<\/a> is a wall of anxiety in institutional discourse.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moreover, during the presentation to OMFIF, the chairman emphasized some key points to address the main issues. As reported, the major concerns were about cyber security, operational resiliency, and a lack of transparency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Besides the crypto industry, climate and finance sectors also need a crypto regulating agency, according to the official statement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Crash of TerraUSD Rises Attention to Crypto Regulation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The calling for a global crypto regulation comes just after the crash of the TerraUSD <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-stablecoins\/\">stablecoin<\/a>. In addition, US politicians are also pressing for strict restrictions in the sector.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Due to the regulatory uncertainty, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin\u2019s<\/a> value has been down by about 30% in the last seven days. At the time of this writing, the digital asset\u2019s all-time high was $28,300.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moving forward, as the industry is facing a rapid expansion, calls for regulation of the crypto sector are increasing as well. Nonetheless, a major issue is the lack of collaboration between regulators around the world. Additionally, some jurisdictions have emerged as crypto-friendly, while others have emerged as crypto-hostile in this regard.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In this chain of events, the IOSCO supports the importance of regulating crypto. Therefore, it has joined many agencies, like the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Home\">International Monetary Fund (IMF)<\/a>. For nations like India, the IMF believes that crypto regulation is a major concern. Additionally, the organization has gone on record warning El Salvador of the risks of legalizing Bitcoin. In response to the lack of a global crypto regulating framework, the IMF presented a guideline in December.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/a-worldwide-crypto-regulatory-framework-will-be-introduced-next-year\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There seems to be a possibility of a worldwide crypto regulatory agency next year.
