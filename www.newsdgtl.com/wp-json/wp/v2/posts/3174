Within six months of its launch, PLCU had matched the world\u2019s best-known cryptocurrency and in less than a year, sprinted past the leading Bitcoin to become more than twice its value.<\/p>\n<p>How PLCU managed to achieve all this was no accident or result of a clever marketing campaign that went viral. PLC Ultima\u2019s incredible success is down to its founder, Alex Reinhardt, choosing to take a very different approach to the hundreds of other crypto projects that launch every year.<\/p>\n<h3>The road to success<\/h3>\n<p>The technology behind PLCU is based on infrastructure that was developed in Switzerland approximately five years ago. The company\u2019s developers used this infrastructure to build a bespoke platform and developed more than ten innovative crypto products in line with the company\u2019s vision.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike the majority of coins available to buy, PLCU wasn\u2019t created to be an investment vehicle that a trader purchases, sits on and waits for its value to increase. This coin was created to be used, and the vision and business model behind it are quite different from anything else out there.<\/p>\n<p>In a recent interview, Alex Reinhardt stated, \u201cMy goal is to bring about a real economy in the crypto-world through PLC Ultima. The vision is to become a mass-market cryptocurrency with the world\u2019s largest user base.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The community is the power behind PLCU, and it\u2019s them who are driving the growth and value of the coin by doing what they normally do on an everyday basis like buying online, going to the grocery store and operating their various types of businesses.<\/p>\n<p>To support the community, PLCU has created an entire ecosystem (or cryptosystem) to make their lives as easy as possible. Innovative products allow the community to carry out their day-to-day purchasing, run a business or even earn income by minting new PLCU coins. In effect, they are a micro-economy with all the tools they need to not only function but thrive.<\/p>\n<p>The best example of one of these products is the innovative PLC Card. This is a physical crypto debit card that can be used online or at any location with an electronic payment terminal. The card has a unique dashboard allowing users to make payments by fiat or a selection of cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<p>Keeping its community not only happy but overjoyed is PLC Ultima\u2019s number one priority because the community is the road that will lead to PLCU\u2019s growth and continued success.<\/p>\n<h3>An expanding community<\/h3>\n<p>PLC Ultima has ensured its community\u2019s continual growth by providing them with all it needs and listening to their wants, needs and suggestions to improve processes. It\u2019s the community who live and work within the PLCU cryptosystem \u2013 therefore, their feedback is invaluable.<\/p>\n<p>With the community itself driving the business, the company believes that it\u2019s the community that should profit the most from PLCU\u2019s increasing value. Thus, the company has implemented a number of steps to ensure this happens, allowing the community to benefit more than the company itself.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the company decreases the production of new coins each month, and more than 50% of coins are frozen for an entire year. The company also burns 1% of every transaction that\u2019s processed, and the company burns 100% of its own coins to not compete with the community for liquidity.<\/p>\n<p>By implementing these steps, the company builds trust and confidence in the coin. In addition, the community feels appreciated and rewarded for their loyalty. As a result, the community themselves recommend others to join the project, which helps to drive the growth of the coin even further. Thus, this delivers a mutually benefiting relationship where everyone wins.<\/p>\n<h3>A future with limitless opportunity<\/h3>\n<p>PLCU\u2019s success story proves that thinking outside the box and daring to take a different road can lead to momentous results. The entire crypto industry is still in its infancy, and technology and ideas are advancing every single day.<\/p>\n<p>PLC Ultima\u2019s founder recently said, \u201cI believe that crypto will continue to go from strength to strength, and we\u2019ll see new technologies and applications materialize that we haven\u2019t even imagined yet. The future looks exciting to me, and I\u2019m positive it will be full of many new opportunities.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In a way, nobody could have predicted <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/plcultima\">PLCU\u2019s<\/a> incredible rise in such a short period of time. By the time the industry reaches its teenage years, who knows what opportunities will present themselves to PLC Ultima and what heights the company might reach?<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/company\/plc-ultima-from-almost-zero-to-crypto-hero\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When PLC Ultima (PLCU) launched in 2021, who could have predicted this new coin would go on to become one of the world\u2019s most valuable cryptocurrencies with a community of more than one million people across 120 countries around the globe.
