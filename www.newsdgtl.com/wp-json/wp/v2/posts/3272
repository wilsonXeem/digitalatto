The blockchain is said to be the world\u2019s first carbon-negative blockchain, as its 0.01% gas and transaction fees get converted into carbon offsets.<\/p>\n<p>The NFTs themselves will be available for <strong>purchase via MoonPay<\/strong> at an undisclosed date in the future, with each asset said to be randomly generated and a completely unique artwork of one of the animals featured at the iconic Queensland zoo.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Adriana Belotti, who is a representative of the Algorand blockchain, had this to say when asked about the fundraising venture: <i>\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see Australia Zoo and Meadow Labs bring wildlife conservation fundraising to the Algorand blockchain, as it really fits in with our core value of sustainability. I\u2019m sure that collecting these NFTs will resonate with everyone who has a soft spot for the iconic Aussie wildlife, both here and abroad\u201d.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>In addition, Robert Irwin, the son of Steve and co-manager of the zoo (alongside his sister and mother), spoke on the importance of the project: <i>\u201cAny innovation that can help our conservation efforts, particularly one that shares our vision of protecting the planet, is something we\u2019re thrilled to support\u201d.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><strong>Follow &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AustraliaZoo\">Australia Zoo<\/a> on Twitter<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
