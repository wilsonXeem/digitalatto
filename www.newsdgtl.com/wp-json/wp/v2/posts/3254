However, like many experiences, owning a piece of its essence is something that is far too abstract to even comprehend. Fortunately, the official title partners of the upcoming Miami Grand Prix, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cryptocom\">Crypto.com<\/a>, are on a mission to dissolve such limits, by creating a collection of NFTs which uniquely depict the sound, speed, and data of each of the race\u2019s laps.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>To transform the characteristics of each lap (which traditionally, can only be described through pundit commentary), Crypto.com will be setting up sensors around the iconic track, which will then pick up the speed, sound, and data of each of the cars in real time. Such data will then be fed back to the company\u2019s on-site NFT gallery \u2018Kinetica,\u2019 which will then<strong> blend the data with an artistic algorithm<\/strong> to generate unique, lap-specific NFT artworks.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>With there being 57 laps in the race, there will be 57 dynamically generated NFTs in the offering, which can each be won by fans who create a Crypto.com account and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto.com\/miami\">register<\/a> their interest before <strong>11:59PM EST<\/strong> on May 8th (i.e. race day). Every successful submitter will also receive a commemorative \u2018Miami Race-Day\u2019 NFT.<\/p>\n<p>To further commemorate the inaugural and first of nine \u2018Crypto.com Miami Grands Prix,\u2019 eight local artists have each been assigned a section of the track as inspiration for an original piece of art. Each artist will impose their artistic styles onto their respective piece of track outline, with the eight sections then being comprised together to create a diverse and flowing collection of art pieces which are tied together through the medium of a singular racing track.<\/p>\n<p>The artwork will be displayed at Kinetica throughout the entire race weekend (May 6-8), which all fans attending the Formula 1 Crypto.com Miami Grand Prix will be able to visit.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
