Investment bank Jefferies <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/01\/20\/jefferies-sees-the-nft-market-reaching-more-than-80-billion-in-value-by-2025\/\">states<\/a> that the NFT market, the backbone of decentralized metaverses, will reach over $80 billion by 2025. Morgan Stanley <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/currencies\/luxury-nfts-metaverse-56-billion-market-revenue-2030-morgan-stanley-2021-11\">believes<\/a> there\u2019s a $56 million opportunity on the table in the luxury goods sector alone.<\/p>\n<p>But when we talk of brands entering the metaverse, what does it really mean? Well, setting up shop in a virtual realm isn\u2019t so different from what you\u2019d need to do here in the meat space. First, you need to acquire metaverse land.<\/p>\n<p>Most metaverses have a defined quantity of land available for purchase as NFTs on primary or secondary markets. Buying land will give you the \u201cspace\u201d you need in the virtual world to start monetizing. Prices may vary, but the scope of what you can do with your land is almost limitless. Here are four ways you can leverage land in the metaverse to max out your possible returns.<\/p>\n<h3>Build a Virtual Commerce Showcase<\/h3>\n<p>E-commerce was one of the premier use cases for the internet, giving rise to the global behemoths that are Amazon and Alibaba \u2013 both e-commerce firms that have expanded far beyond their retail roots. Now, the savviest brands are setting up their v-commerce outlets in the metaverse, allowing users to browse a range of digital and physical products in a customized, branded environment that isn\u2019t constrained by physical boundaries.<\/p>\n<p>Samsung is one example, having launched \u201c<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.trendhunter.com\/trends\/decentraland\">Samsung 837X,<\/a>\u201d its digital-only retail location designed to emulate the firm\u2019s flagship NYC location in the Decentraland metaverse. Decentraland is also set to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theindustry.fashion\/decentraland-to-host-inaugural-metaverse-fashion-week\/\">host<\/a> the first-ever Metaverse Fashion Week at the end of March, so if the event is a success, it seems likely we can expect a few high-end brands to set up virtual outlets in the metaverse.<\/p>\n<h3>Build a Play-to-Earn Game<\/h3>\n<p>The play-to-earn (P2E) craze has taken the gaming world <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2021\/11\/what-play-to-earn-games-mean-for-the-economy-and-metaverse\/\">by storm<\/a> over the last year or so, leading to an <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/forkast.news\/venture-capitalists-falling-for-play-to-earn-startups\/\">influx<\/a> of VC funding for P2E startups. Some metaverses, such as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bullieverse.com\/\">Bullieverse<\/a>, allow users to configure their own P2E games on land in the metaverse, creating the opportunity for developer income based on player revenues.<\/p>\n<p>Bullieverse has integrated Unreal Engine as its game development platform, which offers rich, 3D graphics without even needing any coding tools. It allows users to build games using pre-defined templates and assets.<\/p>\n<p>For brands, this option provides an entirely new revenue stream of gaming income while offering a tailored game to engage potential consumers while paying them token rewards. Bullieverse has also just announced a partnership with Admix, allowing anyone to further monetize their game creations with non-intrusive, opt-in ads from any of the firms 300+ partner brands.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Excited to announce our partnership with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Bullieverse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Bullieverse<\/a> \ud83d\ude80<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re working with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Bullieverse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Bullieverse<\/a> to bring them the most immersive experiences in their metaverse, with custom builds, In-Play billboards, and even branded <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/NFTs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NFTs<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>Learn more about Bullieverse here: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/Abo1yiNa3r\">https:\/\/t.co\/Abo1yiNa3r<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/fYUDCfXO5v\">pic.twitter.com\/fYUDCfXO5v<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Admix (@admixplay) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/admixplay\/status\/1507340744310378539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 25, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Branding specialists can let their imaginations run riot with all the creative ways to position their assets and products within the game itself. Rewards could also be branded, providing users with tokens that can be redeemed for in-store credit or merchandise.<\/p>\n<h3>Host an NFT Art Event<\/h3>\n<p>Along with gaming, NFT art is one of the predominant use cases for the technology right now. Christie\u2019s was the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.christies.com\/auctions\/christies-encrypted\">first<\/a> big-name art auction house to engage with auctions of digital art, while Sotheby\u2019s has joined Samsung by setting up a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/decentraland.org\/blog\/announcements\/sotheby-s-opens-a-virtual-gallery-in-decentraland\/\">virtual auction house<\/a> in Decentraland.<\/p>\n<p>However, some innovators believe that the art buyer UX is currently lacking the metaverse touch. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.realm.art\/\">Realm<\/a> is a metaverse project that wants to do away with the rather sterile, eBay-type listing that NFT art buyers currently experience. Instead, Realm offers artists the opportunity to share and present their NFT creations in a unique and creative way. Think of a customizable AR\/VR gallery that could be floating through space, underwater, or an interactive exhibition based on sound and movement.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone using Realm can create as many realms as they like using a suite of builder tools. Users can create their own exhibition spaces, hold a virtual auction, or invite collaborative creation to explore what\u2019s possible in the world of NFT art in the metaverse.<\/p>\n<h3>Rent It Out<\/h3>\n<p>Still not sure what\u2019s the best use of your metaverse land and want some more time to mull over the options? Why not just rent it out for passive income in the meantime? If you\u2019re on a longer-term time frame, you could <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/marketrealist.com\/p\/how-to-rent-metaverse-land\/\">rent the land<\/a> to another brand to develop any of the ideas outlined above.<\/p>\n<p>But even if you\u2019re on a short-term time frame, there could be other options. For instance, brands wanting to advertise their presence in the metaverse may be willing to rent out your land for advertising space \u2013 think the virtual equivalent of the Golden Arches or a band advertising for an upcoming concert.<\/p>\n<p>The metaverse is still very much in land-grab mode, so if you\u2019re on the fence, consider that even simply buying and holding could be a worthwhile option if prices continue to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/01\/12\/investors-are-paying-millions-for-virtual-land-in-the-metaverse.html\">appreciate<\/a> at the rate they have been. Either way, if your brand isn\u2019t currently thinking about a metaverse strategy, you could find yourself arriving very late to this virtual party.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/company\/how-brands-can-leverage-metaverse-land-for-maximum-returns\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The metaverse is one tech trend showing no signs of waning \u2013 in fact, quite the opposite.
