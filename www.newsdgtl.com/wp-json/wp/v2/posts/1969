This is the third time in 2022 that the DAA dropped by 1.26% on Thursday at a block height of 731,808.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/can-the-600-day-ma-support-line-push-bitcoin-again\/\">Can The 600-Day MA Support Line Push Bitcoin Again?<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bitcoin saw a significant reduction in the difficulty adjustment algorithm on March 7, 2021. As a result, the DAA went down by 27.94%. This was one of the largest reductions in Bitcoin\u2019s lifetime. However, since this change, the hashrate has increased.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With a 1.26% drop in DAA, miners find it easier to find the blocks. Two weeks ago, the difficulty was 28.59 trillion, and today with this decrease, the figures are 28.23 trillion. There are still 1,982 blocks left until the following DAA change.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_488169\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-488169\" style=\"width: 648px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-488169\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/BTCUSD_2022-04-15_01-47-08-460x272.png\" alt=\"BTC price\" width=\"648\" height=\"383\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-488169\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bitcoin is currently trading below its $40,000 support level with a 3.35% decline | Source: BTC\/USD chart from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\">Tradingview.com<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Presently, the difficulty adjustment algorithm is expected to increase in the following change.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The next DAA is estimated on April 28th.

Some estimates assume it may appear on May 3, 2024. As a result, things are turning favorably for miners. Miners can expect a significant boost in revenue with this new halving schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After halving, miners will see their reward cut in half, from 6.25 Bitcoins per block to 3.125 BTCs per block. The network produces about 900 coins daily (144 blocks), and Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate is 1.74%. So far, 90% of all imaginable bitcoins have already been minted- there are only 988481.23 left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/bitcoin-price-could-recovery-above-41-5k\/\">TA: Why Bitcoin Price Could Eye Strong Recovery Above $41.5K<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u2019s been a smooth few days for the mining community as difficulty continues to change, making it easier to find Blocks.
