Prices had been moving sideways for a considerable period of time. Buyers have decided to steer clear of the meme-coin as the short-term reading depicts bearishness on the charts. The coin, however, flashes a bullish pattern on the one-day chart.<\/p>\n<p>The above chart displayed the \u201cAdam\u201d and \u201cEve\u201d pattern continuously for the 109th day and it continues to exhibit the same. This technical formation is considered to be bullish.<\/p>\n<p>The two distinctive valleys that have formed on the charts are referred to as Adam (Triangle) and Eve (Semi-Circle). At $0.00003289, SHIB is expected to experience a break-out and then aim for $0.00004436 and that would mean a 60% hike from the current price level.<\/p>\n<p>If Shiba Inu falls in value further, the nearest support line stands at $0.00002068.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Suggested Reading |<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/press-releases\/metaverse-madness-watch-these-3-metaverse-coins-the-sandbox-sand-shiba-inu-shib-pac-man-frog-pac\/\"> Metaverse Madness: Watch These 3 Metaverse Coins \u2013 The Sandbox (SAND), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pac-Man Frog (PAC)<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Technical Analysis: Four Hour Chart<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_488806\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-488806\" style=\"width: 1791px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-488806 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/SHIBUSD_2022-04-24_23-33-04.png\" alt=\"Shiba Inu\" width=\"1791\" height=\"675\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-488806\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shiba Inu has witnessed a fall in buying strength on the four-hour chart.
