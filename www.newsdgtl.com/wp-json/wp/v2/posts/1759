But very few could have predicted that we would witness such a meteoric rise in the iGaming industry within two decades.<\/p>\n<p>One striking difference between internet casinos in the 90s is the available payment methods. Punters today have access to many more banking options than in the 1990s.<\/p>\n<p>Many casino sites now allow players to deposit and withdraw funds in cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin being the most commonly accepted digital currency. Cryptocurrency online casino sites are hugely popular amongst the players for several reasons.<\/p>\n<p>For starters, Bitcoin casinos offer provable fairness with an extremely fast withdrawal speed. Crypto casinos are also highly secure sites providing users with unrivaled anonymity and transactional discretion.<\/p>\n<p>The rapid growth in crypto casinos online can be directly attributed to advancements in modern technology. Many BTC online casino sites have mobile-compatible applications that allow punters to play casino with Bitcoin even while on the go.<\/p>\n<p>Below, we review 5 of the best Bitcoin casino platforms available to play online. We highlight their key features with particular emphasis on their current bonuses and promotional offers.<\/p>\n<h3>The Making of the Best Bitcoin Online Casinos<\/h3>\n<p>The best crypto casino has certain features that make it stand out from the crowd. While the most obvious feature is the payment methods, many other traits make a trustworthy online casino.<\/p>\n<p>The most telling characteristics of the best BTC casino sites reviewed in this article are highlighted below:<\/p>\n<h4>#1. Licensing:<\/h4>\n<p>All reputable online casinos are regulated, and crypto casino sites are even more so. Today, the best Bitcoin virtual casinos are monitored, supervised, and regulated by renowned governing bodies such as the Gambling Commission, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), Cura\u00e7ao Gaming Authority, and others.<\/p>\n<p>These casinos are issued a renewable eGaming license to operate as internet casinos. It is essential that before you sign up with any Bitcoin gaming site, you confirm that they are appropriately licensed.<\/p>\n<h4>#2. Security:<\/h4>\n<p>Security is critical to both players and the casino industry. Security breeds trust and trust is what drives human traffic to casino sites. The best casinos take time to provide top-notch firewall systems that protect their customers from cyber-attacks.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s world, you have cyber-criminals hell-bent on wreaking havoc through the hacking or cyber theft of either personal information or financial data. Top Bitcoin casino sites run their platforms on 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, one of the most advanced cyber-security protocols available.<\/p>\n<p>They also use Random Number Technology (RNG) to ensure unbiased outcomes in games. Many top casinos are also tested for fairness in results by auditing agencies such as eCogra.<\/p>\n<h4>#3. Gaming:<\/h4>\n<p>What is a Crypto casino site without gaming? It is one of the most crucial parts of what makes the best BTC gaming platforms. Punters should expect to play various video slots, Card, table, arcade, and speciality games with varying themes and bet limits. VIP players can look for a customized betting experience at top casino sites.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the most trending casinos also provide BTC live dealer games to new and experienced punters. Live dealer games offered with high-definition video streaming like Poker, Baccarat, Blackjack, and Roulette are in high demand worldwide.<\/p>\n<h4>#4. Mobile Gambling:<\/h4>\n<p>As technology advances, the casino industry continues to evolve. These days gamblers can enjoy their favourite online casino games on their mobile devices, including mobile phones, smartphones, tablets, and even Apple watches.<\/p>\n<p>Punters can now play Bitcoin casino games in the comfort of their homes or stay connected to their games while in transit. Several BTC casino sites have mobile compatible browsers and games created in HTML5 to provide a great gaming experience to their customers.<\/p>\n<p>Many casinos offer free-to-download mobile applications with functions and features similar to desktop versions. Mobile gaming is the present and indeed future of the casino industry, with BTC crypto casinos taking the lead in progressive change.<\/p>\n<h4>#5. Customer Support:<\/h4>\n<p>Nothing irks customers of casinos more than an unresponsive customer support service. Punters want to be able to make their enquiries and seamlessly express their complaints.<\/p>\n<p>Casinos that offer different means of communication are always sought-after. The promptness of communication with customers is what builds trust and loyalty. That is why the best casinos offer a myriad of customer support tools.<\/p>\n<p>Customer support services are provided through phone calls, emails, contact forms or request tickets, and live chat. Some modern casinos also offer assistance on Whatsapp or Telegram. Most casinos provide 24*7 support service to resolve customer complaints worldwide in the fastest way possible.<\/p>\n<h4>#6. Payment Methods:<\/h4>\n<p>Bitcoin may be the most revered cryptocurrency, but this is usually not the only form of digital currency accepted by the best casino with cryptocurrency payments. In addition to Bitcoin, the other popular cryptos accepted for both deposits and withdrawals at top gambling sites include Tether, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum.<\/p>\n<p>BTC crypto casinos also offer traditional payment methods through Bank Transfers, Debit\/Credit cards, and payments through e-wallets with high deposit and withdrawal limits. However, punters familiar with the cryptocurrency payment option know that it offers the best in terms of transaction speed, security, and anonymity.<\/p>\n<h4>#7. Bonuses:<\/h4>\n<p>Bonuses are the gold standard for many players when choosing a BTC crypto casino. Many scour the internet for casino sites with the most promising bonus offers and reasonable wagering requirements.<\/p>\n<p>Bonuses can boost your overall winnings and earn you lucrative payouts. Most casinos offer some form of a Welcome Bonus to all newcomers. This entry-level bonus offer may be a \u201cDeposit Match Bonus\u201d, which is quite common or a \u201cNo Deposit Bonus\u201d, quite rare.<\/p>\n<p>Other bonuses offered by many casinos accepting BTC include Daily, Weekly, and Seasonal bonuses. Some casinos also have a series of rewards in VIP or Loyalty Programs to encourage, motivate, and maintain the patronage of their regular customers.<\/p>\n<h3>Review of 5 Top BTC Crypto Casinos<\/h3>\n<p>The seven traits and features highlighted above are peculiar to the best crypto casino online platforms.
