Chief Executive of Coinbase said, \u201cWithout tailored legislative solutions that are openly debated with public participation, the United States risks unnecessarily onerous and chilling laws and regulations.\u201d I think it is promising that lawmakers are meeting with executives to discuss how to go about regulating the industry, and I am hopeful that regulatory clarity will come in the next few years to help the industry expand without harming innovation.<\/p>\n<p>Goldman Sachs CEO, David Solomon, said he believes that the underlying blockchain technology is more important than Bitcoin itself. Solomon stated that he is a big believer in the disruption that these technologies are causing. He said, \u201cthe key thing is how can blockchain or other technologies that are not developed yet accelerate the pace of the digitization of the way financial services are delivered.\u201d This is why Goldman Sachs have implemented a services app to try to incorporate crypto.<\/p>\n<p>This will not be the last meeting on the subject.
