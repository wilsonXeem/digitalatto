It was led by Andreessen Horowitz, who maintained the cryptocurrency\u2019s comeback. As a result, millions of dollars were raised.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After a 7.5% rise in the price of APE over the day, it now trades at $14.50 each. Interestingly, the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrency\u2019s<\/a> rise in value came as part of a retracement rebound. It all began this week when it was trading at a low of $9.50 price. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Correspondingly, there was a 50% increase in profit for the week ending March 21. Thus, APE has been ranked as one of the top-performing digital assets since that date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The ApeCoin digital currency was created on March 17 through an \u201cairdrop\u201d supported by Yuga Labs. Yuga Labs is the founder of the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-a-bored-ape\/\">Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)<\/a>. Moreover, it is a collection of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-nft-non-fungible-tokens\/\">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)<\/a> popular among celebrities, sportsmen, and venture capitalists for its so-called status symbol.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Diving Into More Detail About ApeCoin<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Out of the 1 billion APE issued, Yuga Labs distributed 150 million APE to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/hodlers-meaning\/\">holders<\/a> of Bored Ape NFTs. On Thursday, they received 10,904 tokens per piece, valued roughly at $158,000, for free. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">On the other hand, owners of the Mutant Apes earned 2,042 APE, worth about $30,000 at today\u2019s price.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The company sees APE as a governance and utility token. In this manner, it will let its owners run the ApeCoin DAO. In addition, ApeCoin DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization. Hence, people who own an APE can vote on decisions made in the BAYC ecosystem. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There is a statement by an excerpt from the ApeCoin official website. As noted, it will be a protocol layer for community-led projects that move culture into the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-and-metaverse\/\">Metaverse<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The ApeCcoin community has issued 5 proposals, including the DAO structure; the voting process; the allocation of the ecological budget; the rules for staking and the allocation of staking pool. More than half of the budget goes to the game development. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/s1vq8v623g\">https:\/\/t.co\/s1vq8v623g<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WuBlockchain\/status\/1506891345340022790?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 24, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Furthermore, Yuga Labs rewarded people who helped it get started. The reward contains some of its stock. The first investors who helped Yuga Labs were Andreessen Horowitz and Animoca Brands. The gifted stock is worth about $2 billion at today\u2019s prices. On Tuesday, the company raised $450 million from the same investors. Its worth reached $4 billion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Following the contributors\u2019 list, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/ftx.com\">FTX<\/a>, the crypto exchange, is also participating in the funding round. Yuga said the money would grow its development team and manage its upcoming projects. For example, a possible metaverse project is called \u201cOtherside.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, Yuga may also use the money to make Bored and Mutant Apes bigger brands. Some of them might be appearing on luxury goods and a play-to-win game that may use APE tokens. This is just one of the ways Yuga may use the money.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Looks like every single exchange is listing <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%24APE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$APE<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m here for this.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 David Gokhshtein (@davidgokhshtein) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/davidgokhshtein\/status\/1506651332912029703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 23, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Future of APE<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Since ApeCoin is only a week old, it does not have enough history to predict how the price will move in the future. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">On lower-timeframe charts, APE is still trending higher. As a result, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/investing-vs-trading-crypto\/\">traders<\/a> buy when the price is at the lower trendline and sell when the price hits the upper trendline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Therefore, APE\u2019s current rebound move could help it keep going up until it reaches the channel\u2019s upper trendline near $15. Unfortunately, this coincides with another <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/resistance-level-definition\/\">resistance level<\/a> from March 18-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In the meantime, APE is fighting to regain $14.25 in short-time assistance. However, it is not succeeding in doing so. This might result in an early retreat down the channel\u2019s bottom trendline. This is also where its 20-hour exponential moving average (20-hour EMA, or the green wave) is at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/apecoins-price-increases-by-50\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ApeCoin (APE) seems to increase its chances for surging up, as it closed above a critical support level.
