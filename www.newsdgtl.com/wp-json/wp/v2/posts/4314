Which most likely means that the bottom has not been made.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moreover, Moya talked about the European Central Bank President Christine, who previously said digital currencies are \u201cworth nothing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/solana-sol-could-register-an-upswing-thanks-to-this-pattern\/\">Solana (SOL) Could Register An Upswing, Thanks To This Pattern<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIt is unlikely that any head of a central bank will endorse bitcoin or the other top coins.
