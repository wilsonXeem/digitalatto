Its mission was to drive and fund the development of a new blockchain network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In April 2016, the Waves team staged an initial coin offering (ICO) for their WAVES cryptocurrency, raising the equivalent of $22 million (which is approximately 30,000 BTC). In the last quarter of 2016, the Waves blockchain was released.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is Waves (WAVES)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Waves enable the creation and trading of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a> tokens without the need for complex smart contract implementation. On the other hand, tokens may be produced and controlled using scripts that run in user accounts on the Waves blockchain network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The idea is that inventing new tokens (and the apps that control them) should be similar to establishing a standard web application. To achieve this goal, programs and apps are executed as attachments to these transactions, and new assets are given a unique identifier. Scripts may only be attached when the asset is created.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">These assets are designed to be traded inside the Waves ecosystem. This ecosystem has its own built-in decentralized exchange (Waves Exchange). Smart contract capability was implemented on the Waves mainnet in 2018 by the WAVES team. This implementation allowed a third party to make <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/dapp-meaning-what-are-dapps\/\">decentralized apps (DApps)<\/a>. Later in 2019, the Waves platform team began promoting Waves enterprise, a version of the network designed for institutions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How Does WAVES Work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Waves blockchain supports two types of nodes:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Full nodes<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lightweight nodes<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">On the one hand, full nodes maintain a complete history of transactions.

This system allows Waves lite users \u2013 those who did not operate a full node \u2013 to lease their WAVES tokens to mining nodes. Leased WAVES are neither transferable nor tradeable and must remain in the user\u2019s account.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, the account holder has complete control over the tokens, and leases may be canceled at any moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_26364\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26364\" style=\"width: 1850px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-26364\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Waves Leased POS\" width=\"800\" height=\"413\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/f1efefe4df754bb5a76b9d4370be5c6e.jpeg\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-26364\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/f1efefe4df754bb5a76b9d4370be5c6e.jpeg\" alt=\"Waves Leased POS\" width=\"800\" height=\"413\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-26364\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Leased proof-of-stake (LPoS) Source: Golden<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Waves-NG<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The network was upgraded again in December 2017 with the introduction of Waves-NG. This was a unique protocol based on Cornell IT professor Emin Gun Sirer\u2019s Bitcoin-NG proposal. The original Bitcoin protocol selects each miner randomly. Miners compete to discover a valid hash for the next block depending on the current state of the blockchain once a block is uploaded to the blockchain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Meanwhile, freshly created transactions are placed in the memory pool (mempool), where they will stay pending until a miner gathers and verifies them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Waves-NG separated the Waves blockchain into two other kinds of blocks:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Key blocks are created by choosing a random proof-of-stake miner. Then, in the same block, a public key is used by other nodes.

It costs you 0.004 WAVES to execute a script.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Waves allows users to create tokens without having to know how to program them.

Of course, our forecast is based on hours of research and analysis. Nevertheless, this is not financial advice, so please proceed with caution and always do your own research (DYOR).<\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crypto Academy Waves (WAVES) Price Prediction 2022<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Waves current price range may pique the interest of many traders. As a result, we predict that WAVES might reach $26.10 by the end of 2022 with substantial partnerships with financial institutions. With an average price of $19.30, it has the potential to outperform its current price trend and set new highs. The price tagline may change as the cryptocurrency market gets more <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-volatility\/\">volatile<\/a> toward the end of 2022.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crypto Academy Waves (WAVES) Price Prediction 2023<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The cryptocurrency market is driven by volatility. Thus, it is difficult to predict and stay up with current pricing today. The crypto bans and additional limitations are still causing alarm among cryptocurrency users. If the market is a bit more bullish during 2023, we predict that the Waves price may surpass $31. Given that it is expected to be held by long-term investors, we suggest that its average price for 2023 may be around $30.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crypto Academy Waves (WAVES) Price Prediction 2024<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We at Crypto Academy suggest that Waves could see a rise in the long run. 2024 might be the year that WAVES reaches $50 considering the fact that the next\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin-halving\/\"> Bitcoin halving<\/a> will occur that year. Thus, we predict that its highest price might reach as high as $57.50. If the market is bullish by then, the minimum price might rise to $43.10.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crypto Academy Waves (WAVES) Price Prediction 2025<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Waves price might reach new highs due to the large community and, as such, will be considered a better alternative. Moreover, price variations are difficult to predict, especially when the market is more bullish or bearish than it has ever been. We predict that the WAVES price might reach as high as $105.10 by 2025. The average price may be around $84.30.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crypto Academy Waves (WAVES) Price Prediction 2026<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The WAVES token has enormous potential, and with certain partnerships and innovations, the number of users and adoption may increase. If the market focuses on investing in Waves, the price might skyrocket. We predict that the highest price for 2026 might be $110. If the market falls, the WAVES price is predicted to turn around a little. 2026 might end with an average price of $100, with a low of $85.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_26361\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26361\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-26361\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Waves Price Forecast Chart\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-1-8.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-26361\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-1-8.png\" alt=\"Waves Price Forecast Chart\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-26361\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Crypto Academy Waves (WAVES) Price Prediction for 2022-2026.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Waves (WAVES) Market Price Prediction<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is possible that the price of WAVES can exceed in the future.
