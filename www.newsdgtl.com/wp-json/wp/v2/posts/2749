Besides that, there are several ways to profit from this market. What makes it even more interesting is the fact that you can generate passive income through most of these ways. For example, you can buy a mining rig and start mining <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/dogecoin-price-prediction-2022\/\">Dogecoin<\/a>, or tens of other minable cryptos. Moreover, you can stake your crypto holdings and receive staking rewards on a daily, weekly, monthly, or annual basis. Plutus, however, had a more creative approach to crypto rewards. This crypto project rewards its customers with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/pluton-price-prediction-2022\/\">Pluton (PLU)<\/a> for each cent they spend shopping. Let us show you what this crypto project is all about.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Pluton (PLU)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, Pluton is the native token of the Plutus platform. This token\u2019s ticker is PLU and its main utility is being distributed as rewards. Moreover, it is an ERC-20 token that operates on the Ethereum blockchain and it was the first-ever crypto reward token conceptualized in 2016 (<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/plutus.it\/public\/white-paper.pdf\">Whitepaper<\/a>). Let us take a look at how Plutus works and how you can profit from it. First, you will need to open an account on the Plutus platform. To finish this process, you will first need to download their mobile app from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=it.plutus.android&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US\">Google Play<\/a> or <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/gb\/app\/plutus-bank-on-crypto\/id1410685948\">App Store<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Plutus Card<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main product of Plutus is their Visa Debit Card which you can order from their website for free. This card works similar to any other card, however, at the time of writing, it only supports EUR and GBP in the UK and Europe (EEA regions). As you use this card, you will get rewarded with PLU, which you can later swap to ETH. So you are essentially mining ETH by spending GBP\/EUR for groceries. These rewards in PLU will be sent to your personal <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-wallet-definition\/\">wallet<\/a> attached to your card, meaning that you will have first-hand access to them. Since the Plutus card is non-custodial, you can spend your crypto anywhere, without giving up your private keys. This is something quite astonishing when you think about how credit\/debit cards work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most interesting part are the perks of staking PLU. At the time of writing, Plutus has a partnership with Netflix, Spotify, Apple One, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Apple Store, Asos, eBay, Uber Eats, Starbucks, Uber, Shell, Booking, Airbnb, and several other companies. Imagine <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/pos-meaning-in-crypto-what-is-proof-of-stake\/\">staking<\/a> your crypto, earning rewards, and earning a free Netflix, Spotify, and Disney+ subscription. This is literally the meaning of earning as you spend. Those maximizing their monthly spend with higher reward rates and perks can earn up to \u00a3\/\u20ac750.00 per month in crypto rewards.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plutus Reward System<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Plutus Reward System is based on their Visa debit card. As this project promotes cashback, you will get rewarded based on how much you spend. The minimum rewards you can get are 3% in the form of PLU <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/token-meaning-what-is-a-cryptocurrency-token\/\">tokens<\/a>. Moreover, you can stake your rewards to earn even more. The more you stake, the more the reward percentage increases, and it can go up to 8%.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<table style=\"width: 77.784%;\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 13.6461%;\"><b>Level<\/b><\/th>\n<th style=\"width: 18.9765%;\"><b>PLU Staked<\/b><\/th>\n<th style=\"width: 11.5139%;\"><b>Perks<\/b><\/th>\n<th style=\"width: 31.7697%;\"><b>Bonus<\/b><\/th>\n<th style=\"width: 123.824%;\"><b>Reward Rate<\/b><\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 13.6461%;\"><b>Hero\u00a0<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9765%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">250 PLU<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5139%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4 Perks<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 31.7697%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-Fungible Token<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 123.824%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4% Rewards<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 13.6461%;\"><b>Veteran<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9765%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">500 PLU<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5139%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5 Perks<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 31.7697%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-Fungible Token<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 123.824%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5% Rewards<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 13.6461%;\"><b>Legend<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9765%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,000 PLU<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5139%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6 Perks<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 31.7697%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-Fungible Token<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 123.824%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6% Rewards<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 13.6461%;\"><b>G.O.A.T.<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9765%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2,000 PLU<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5139%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8 Perks<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 31.7697%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-Fungible Token<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 123.824%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8% Rewards<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plutus Payment Plans<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, let us move to payment plans.

Moving on, PLU hit an all-time high of $32.76 back on the 6th of January 2018. Pluton hit its yearly high for 2022 on the 25th of January when it reached a trading value of $22.54. At the time of writing, Pluton has a trading value of $7.35 and a market capitalization of $13.49 million.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pluton has a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-circulating-supply-and-maximum-supply\/\">total supply<\/a> of 20 million, with only 1.85 million in circulation as of right now. The more people receive rewards for using the Plutus Visa debit card, the more PLU enters the market. You can purchase PLU in several <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-exchange\/\">cryptocurrency exchanges<\/a>. Some of them are KuCoin, AscendEX (formerly known as BitMax), Bitfinex, Hoo, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/coinbase-review\/\">Coinbase Exchange<\/a>, and Huobi Global. Since PLU is an ERC-20 token, you can also find it in the Uniswap DEX. To wrap it up, Pluton has a 24-hour <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/understanding-crypto-trading-volume\/\">trading volume<\/a> of $728,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>To get in direct contact with the project\u2019s team, join their Discord channel.
