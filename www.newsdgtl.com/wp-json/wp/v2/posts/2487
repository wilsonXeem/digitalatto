Well, the Dogecoin killer Shiba Inu (SHIB) has performed way beyond the standards of a top-performing asset. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The standard is around the figures of 2,000% or a little higher. However, Shiba Inu was able to surpass that in 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In fact, not even Bitcoin or Ethereum was able to reach that pinnacle of sorts. That humongous one-year gain by SHIB was enough for traders and crypto enthusiasts to compare Shiba Inu with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/5BaetJBW\/\" width=\"1834\" height=\"875\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">SHIB total market cap at $13.50 billion on the weekend chart | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Suggested Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/tech\/shiba-inu-kicks-off-metaverse-project\/\">Shiba Inu Kicks Off Metaverse Project; SHIB Rallies 14% In The Last 7 Days<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite the criticisms and naysayers, SHIB was able to go beyond the expectations of many.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What makes SHIB more robust than ever in 2021 is the fact that it has worked doubly hard to increase its visibility to its target market. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">SHIB has amassed great profits in the past two years. It was able to increase its market liquidity and capitalization. The popular vote on the SHIB fence has also increased its following and investors. In fact, the SHIB community has grown so rapidly to more than 1 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>SHIB \u2013 The Most-Searched Crypto in 2021<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Shiba Inu is also regarded as the most-searched crypto last year. It has clearly outperformed Bitcoin in terms of popularity and market value. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It might be an issue of having too much information regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum. Clearly, SHIB is enjoying the spotlight and looks ready to \u2018bark\u2019 louder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to Google Trends, the demand for Bitcoin has died down a bit in the past couple of months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Shiba Inu has dropped to 4% which gives more opportunity for a buy-in before the prices go up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The token\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) is now below 50.
