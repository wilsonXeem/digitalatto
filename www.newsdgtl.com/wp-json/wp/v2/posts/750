Thus, the game released a few teases on Twitter. Accordingly, Nicolas Veiga, Binamon\u2019s CEO and software architect, released a 26-second video on March 17. The video delivers the message \u201csow today, harvest tomorrow @binamok.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Sow today, harvest tomorrow <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/binamonok?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@binamonok<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/aqCwRJcacj\">pic.twitter.com\/aqCwRJcacj<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 CEO \u2013 Nico Software Architect at Binamon\u2122 &amp; TANGO\u2122 (@CeoNicoOk) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CeoNicoOk\/status\/1504583545980952579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 17, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The in-game cinematic sound is the most recent addition to the future game. In addition, the game\u2019s entrance tune will be accessible in both English and Japanese, as reported by the CEO.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As per the record, the online game Binamon is based on NFTs and runs on the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchain<\/a>. It is a world of digital monsters where players fight and defeat monsters to get BMON tokens. Additionally, gamers stake their Binamons (Genesis NFTs) and earn money through staking. This is a way to make money without having to do any work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In a general analysis, it is obvious that Binamon is developing one of the greatest<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-decentralized-finance\/\"> Decentralized Finance (DeFi)<\/a> games available. Additionally, the game will be enormous in the NFT and GameFi sector, aiming to involve the online community. The official trailer may be seen on the protocol\u2019s website. The DeFi sector keeps growing each day with such partnerships.
