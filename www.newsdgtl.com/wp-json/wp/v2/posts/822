Recently, developer 0xMaki <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/forum.sushi.com\/t\/enter-the-stargate-omnichain-strategy\/9741\">shared<\/a> a proposal to integrate SushiSwap with LayerZero via their first omnichain application called Stargate Finance.<\/p>\n<p>LayerZero is a decentralized cross-chain solution to integrate multiple blockchains. The protocol allows the network to interact and communicate without a third party or token.<\/p>\n<p>In that way, for SushiSwap, LayerZero and Stargate remove friction from the process of swapping tokens from a native chain to an alternative blockchain. The developer explained:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>LayerZero, and is an Omnichain asset transfer protocol that leverages the Delta \u0394 Algorithm to solve the bridging trilemma:<\/p>\n<p>Instant Guaranteed Finality: the guarantee of funds on the destination chain when a transaction is successfully committed on the source chain.<\/p>\n<p>Unified Liquidity: the shared access of a single liquidity pool between multiple chains.<\/p>\n<p>Native Assets: the user-desired assets (native or most liquid synthetic) on the destination chain.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>SushiSwap has been released on multiple blockchains, and with LayerZero and its Stargate application, the protocol could combine all its liquidity without a single point of failure.<\/p>\n<p>This means the different versions of the DEX on Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Fantom, and others could launch unify cross-chain strategies and merge their total value locked.<\/p>\n<p>According to 0xMaki\u2019s proposal, an integration with Stargate would \u201cfacilitate\u201d the transfer and swapping of tokens between native assets. In that way, SushiSwap could see its potential \u201cunlock\u201d and provide users with an improved experience to perform cross-chain trading, new strategies, and increase liquidity across SUSHI pools.<\/p>\n<h2>SushiSwap Goes Beyond One Single Blockchain<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to these features, Stargate facilitates transactions by tracking the user\u2019s gas reserves. As the developer explained, the application can move gas between different blockchains to enable a transaction. 0xMaki added:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This eliminates the pains and struggles of trying to find a gas faucet, requesting gas from another user, or trusting that a User Application will send you enough gas after transferring.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Stargate and its native token STG have attracted the attention of major players in the crypto space. Sam Trabucco, CEO at Alameda Research, expressed the firm\u2019s long-term bullish thesis for STG.<\/p>\n<p>The firm participated in STG\u2019s recent auction where they \u201cbought all the tokens\u201d. The assets will be kept under lock for at least 3 years.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The cross-chain asset management opens up a wide array of possible DeFi use cases, makes capital allocation for firms like Alameda more seamless, and aids in making the crypto markets more efficient \u2014 among many other benefits <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/StargateFinance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@StargateFinance<\/a> is creating.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Sam Trabucco (@AlamedaTrabucco) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AlamedaTrabucco\/status\/1506306853571026957?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 22, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/defi\/sushiswap-escaped-350m-defi-hack\/\">SushiSwap Narrowly Escaped A $350 Million DeFi Hack, Here\u2019s How<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>STG was recently launched on crypto exchange FTX via the spot market.
