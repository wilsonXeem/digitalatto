The headline is that, ban or no ban, the Asian country controls 21% of the Global Bitcoin mining hashrate. Since June 2021, here in NewsBTC, we\u2019ve been wracking our brains trying to figure out <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/why-did-china-ban-bitcoin-mining-here-are-the-seven-leading-theories\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">why did China ban bitcoin mining<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Maybe we were barking at the wrong tree the whole time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to the CCAF\u2019s numbers, unsurprisingly the \u201cUS has remained at the forefront of Bitcoin mining and extended its leading position (37.84%).\u201d For their part, \u201cChina has re-emerged as a major mining hub (21.11%). Kazakhstan (13.22%), Canada (6.48%), and Russia (4.66%) have been relegated to more distant places.\u201d Let\u2019s see what else can we learn from the CCAF\u2019s numbers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Is China All The Way Back? How Did This Happen?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As it turns out, the CCAF analysis uncovered numbers that \u201cstrongly suggest that significant underground mining activity has formed in the country\u201d. Can we be sure that the explanation is real? And if it is, how did the underground China bitcoin mining industry surge so fast?<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cFollowing the government ban in June 2021, reported hashrate for the entire country effectively plummeted to zero during the months of July and August. Yet reported hashrate suddenly surged back to 30.47 EH\/s in September 2021, instantly catapulting China to second place globally in terms of installed mining capacity (22.29% of total market).\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The report wonders what happened, \u201ca comeback of this magnitude within the period of one month would seem unlikely given physical constraints, as it takes time to find existing or build new non-traceable hosting facilities at that scale\u201d. And theorizes that maybe the underground miners were using VPNs to hide their location and then, suddenly, decided that they were safe enough to stop hiding. Which seems unlikely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-490761 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/BTCUSD_2022-05-18_04-46-34-460x256.png\" alt=\"BTCUSD price chart for 05\/18\/2022 - TradingView\" width=\"460\" height=\"256\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC price chart for 05\/18\/2022 on Bitfinex | Source: BTC\/USD on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/BTCUSD\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Non-China Countries<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sadly but predictably, the study also found out that \u201cthe hashrate recovery has not been distributed evenly\u201d. How did the non-China countries in the Top 5 do in the studied period?<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The United States \u201csurpassed the rest of the world in terms of hashrate growth. This is evidenced by installed capacity surging from 42.74 EH\/s (35.40%) in August 2021 to 70.97 EH\/s (37.84%) in January 2022.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In Kazakhstan, for their part, \u201cTotal hashrate continued to increase in September and peaked at 27.31 EH\/s in October, until repeated power outages towards the end of last year, and a week-long internet shutdown earlier this year, forced miners to temporarily suspend operations.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Surprisingly, \u201cRussia on the other hand not only experienced a substantial drop in relative hashrate share from 11.23% in August 2021 to 4.66% in January 2022, but also a significant decline in total installed mining capacity contribution from 13.56 EH\/s to 8.74 EH\/s over the same period.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Last but not least, \u201cCanada experienced only a moderate increase in its hashrate from 11.54 EH\/s in August 2021 to 12.15 EH\/s in January 2022, which resulted in a loss in market share from 9.55% to 6.48% as total network hashrate was growing significantly faster. \u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The CCAF Spreads FUD<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance couldn\u2019t pass the opportunity to spread some unfounded rumors about bitcoin mining. This is what the CCAF said:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThese geographic shifts in mining activities bring to the fore how relocations impact the overall sustainability of the network. For instance, recent research has suggested that the Chinese decision to ban Bitcoin mining has indeed worsened \u2013 rather than improved \u2013 Bitcoin\u2019s environmental footprint.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The CCAF is using <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-mining-more-damaging-to-the-environment-after-china-ban-study-says\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">this study\u2019s findings<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which basically says that they NOW believe what bitcoiners always said. That China was mostly using hydropower energy for bitcoin mining, and not coal. The fact is, as far as using green energy, bitcoin mining continues to be <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/controversial-bitcoin-mining-council-confirms-sustainable-power-mix\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the cleanest industry in the world<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Whenever we find intentional FUD spreading like this one right here, we have to check out who paid for the study. As it turns out, the numbers come directly from the Cambridge Digital Assets Programme. The CCAF host the CDAP \u201cin collaboration with 16 prominent public and private institutions\u201d. Among them, we find the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Mastercard, Visa, and the World Bank.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And right then, everything made sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Featured Image by <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\/users\/publicdomainpictures-14\/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=15930\">PublicDomainPictures<\/a> from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=15930\">Pixabay<\/a> | Chart by <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/\">TradingView<\/a><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/new-data-shows-china-still-controls-21-of-the-global-bitcoin-mining-hashrate\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>China is back with a vengeance.
