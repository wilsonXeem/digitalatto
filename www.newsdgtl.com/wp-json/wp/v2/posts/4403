However, the bears protected major gains above the key <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/eth\/ethereum-forms-bullish-pattern-2k\/\">$2,000 zone<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The price started a fresh decline from the $2,020 swing high.

There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,970 on the hourly chart of ETH\/USD.

A close above the $2,000 level could open the doors for a steady increase. In the stated case, ether price could rise towards the $2,085 resistance zone.
