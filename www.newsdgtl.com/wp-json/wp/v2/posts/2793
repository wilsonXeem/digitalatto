The market is now in a sideways trend, and there may be some short-term consolidation. The market will be bearish if it falls below $99, but if the bulls regain control, a return to $103 is possible.<\/p>\n<p>The market\u2019s slide is being held back by the negative trendline, but buyers are striving to go beyond it. As market hesitation takes hold, the RSI indicator is trading near the 50.0 level. The MACD has crossed over to the bearish side, which might send prices lower in the short term, but the bulls are still trying to push prices higher.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, another slide to the downside might be triggered by a likely rejection from the 55-day SMA, which bulls have been unable to push and close prices above over the past four trading days. Bears have enough room to move lower with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) below 50, setting up the perfect strategy to break below the $95 level and open up the can for another 10% loss to $85. If that level fails to hold, the $75 level, which was identified by the bearish triangle established in February and March, may come into play.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/dogecoin-doge-struggles-drops-9\/\">Dogecoin (DOGE) Struggles, Drops 9% After Elon Musk Twitter Buyout<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<pre>Featured image from The Getty Images, chart from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/solana\/solana-stumbles-at-100-level-as-bulls-recover-the-market\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Solana price action indicates that bulls are attempting to regain the market.
