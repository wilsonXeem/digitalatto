However, the<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0decision by the Nox Bitcoin exchange reflects the Brazilian customer protection regulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The exchange also offers staking services, such as Anchor Protocol, which UST heavily uses. The DeFi protocol offered up to<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">20% APY on UST staking and was primarily seen as being instrumental in its collapse due to these unsustainable yields.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">People are now waiting to see what happens next regarding listing UST and LUNA. \u201cIt is possible that this will no longer exist in the near future,\u201d stated Oliveira before adding, \u201cbut you never know what can happen in an unpredictable crypto market.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><b><i>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/cosmos-skyrockets-12\/\">Cosmos (ATOM) Skyrockets 12% Following Bitcoin And Ethereum Recovery<\/a><br \/><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/?symbol=BITSTAMP%3ABTCUSD\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tradingview<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, UST is trading at $0.067 with a 1% increase at the time of writing.
