This is because they have achieved more liquidity in less time. They have the support of the largest liquidity providers in the space, TUSD and USDC. They are optimistic about becoming one of the best crypto derivatives exchanges, as it has a proven record of success. This is because they have a good team they call an All-Star team that can make it become a dominant player by entering a crowded space and breaking the status quo. They come from many leading tech companies: Google, Facebook, Jane Street, Optiver, and Susquehanna.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alameda Research is an approximately $100 million AUM quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm that is the largest liquidity provider and market maker in the space, and it backs FTX. According to their market <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-volatility\/\">volatility<\/a>, Alameda trades between $600 million and $1 billion every day and ranks number fourth on the BitMEX leaderboard. FTX has also launched an automated OTC RFQ system that could scale our volume to $30 million per day without marketing and quickly provide some tightest spreads in the industry. Hence, it serves as the largest exchange and OTC desk and anticipates even faster growth with the marketing of FTX.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTX (FTT) Fundamental Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTX has been one of the largest crypto futures traders since its inception by resolving many problems, writing countless white papers, and giving much feedback to these <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/top-9-cryptocurrency-exchanges-in-2021\/\">exchanges<\/a>. They have taken the development into their own hands by clawback prevention, centralized collateral pool, universal stablecoin settlement, innovation of new products in leveraged tokens, and USDT Futures. FTX aims to reduce the chances of clawbacks as other derivative exchanges lose a large number of customer funds as claimed by socialized losses. They significantly reduce such happenings by using a three-tiered liquidation model.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTX derivatives are settled with stable coins and need only one universal margin wallet to solve the issue of traders rebalancing and preventing positions from getting liquidated. The present future exchanges have fragmented collateral across many separate tokens and margin wallets. Its innovative product, leveraged tokens, lets the traders put on short and leveraged positions without margin trading. Other products are USDT futures that will act as game-changers. As several big crypto firms highly need some way to hedge USDT deltas due to their historical volatility, USDT futures will provide them with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we have mentioned before, Alameda Research backs FTX, so many of FTX\u2019s capabilities rely on Alameda\u2019s expertise, making it unreplicable. FTX exchange is live and functional, unlike many other exchanges conducting token raises. It was very liquid from the first day compared to many other future exchanges. The experts in this domain have designed FTX carefully, and one of the heaviest users of products has redesigned everything, including collateral, maintenance margin, liquidation processes, and product listing from the ground. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They first launched USDT futures and leveraged tokens as they are in huge demand and are becoming popular. Their development cycle is very short, and their multiple features can roll out multiple features every day, as Alameda\u2019s tech team is experienced in making complex crypto trading systems. Also, they have strong partnerships with USDC and TUSD, and Alameda is a part of secondary markets, having strong connections with top exchanges, trading firms, etc., for partnering with FTX.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How FTX Works<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their model for producing revenues of exchange fees and trading fees from leverage tokens and listing fees\u2019 volume consists of six main aspects mentioned below.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Conventional Crypto PR\/Marketing:<\/strong> They want to plan for releasing PR articles regarding trading competitions, meetups, traditional and crypto news outlets, content writing, employing influencers, AMAs, referral programs, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>FTX OTC:<\/strong> They have united their OTC portal with FTX, giving easy access to derivatives to all the OTC counterparties. They estimate their existing OTC user base accounts\u2019 future volume of about $150m\/day. They also think that their OTC user base will dramatically grow after marketing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Stablecoin Fiat Gateway:<\/strong> They have strong relationships with the teams of TUSD and USDC. They are exchangeable through FTX OTC for large sizes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Listing New Leveraged Tokens on FTX:<\/strong> They want to collaborate with popular projects for listing on their leveraged tokens.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Listing Leveraged Tokens on Other Exchanges:<\/strong> They hope for the listing of leveraged tokens on other venues and can achieve their target exposure by trading futures on FTX. Increased volume of leveraged tokens will also enhance FTX\u2019s future volume.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Future Initiatives:<\/strong> They planned to add options, exchange tokens, and spot margin trading to FTX in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokenomics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTX\u2019s native token is called FTX <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-tokenomics\/\">token<\/a> or FTT. About one-third of all FTX-generated fees will be utilized for the repurchase of FTT, which will be burned. The platform will provide low trading fees with a discount on FTX futures and tighter spreads for OTC. FTT can also serve as collateral for future positions to increase utility and demand for FTT. Their brack tests and live stimulations have demonstrated that their backstop liquidity fund will experience an overall gain during a market movement instead of clawbacks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some portion of this gain will be used for socializing among FTT. They are also willing to collaborate with other projects that want to create leveraged tokens with their coins. Crypto institutions have some interest in buying a white label version of their OTC portal and future exchange in exchange for FTT. So FTT is the basic support system of the FTX ecosystem and will become even more useful after the addition of other derivatives of the asset.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTX Future Plans<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They think FTX will be the most well-reputed asset among these cryptocurrencies in the field of liquidity, along with the most attractive products, built-in flow, and substantial room for further growth over time. As Alameda Research OTC trades $30m\/day, the team is working on moving all these clients to FTX OTC. They will expect their OTC volume with the addition of marketing; we expect our OTC volumes to double, adding another $30m\/day. They are onboarding and getting good feedback from famous crypto trade firms that can lead to further FTX volume increase of a minimum of $10m\/ day. They will also list leveraged tokens on other exchanges to add up another $10m\/day of FTX volume. Considering these factors, they anticipate a $100m\/day volume, with a real possibility of $1b\/day. Their cheapest token has a $35 million <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\">market capitalization<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTX (FTT) Price Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTT, the native cryptocurrency token of the trading platform FTX, was launched on May 8, 2019, and was first traded on July 31, 2022.
