With its upcoming release of \u2018The Seed\u2019 NFT collection, it will be able to fund and achieve its goal of becoming the world\u2019s leading and most sustainable hemp plant innovator.<\/p>\n<h4><b>The Seed NFTs<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>To help propel the company towards its climate saving ambitions, it is launching an NFT collection called \u2018The Seed\u2019. Funds raised from the sale will be directly reinvested into the company, in order to scale out its operations.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Seed NFTs are rare and collectible pieces of art which are sold directly by G\u00fcdphoria itself. Each NFT is a digital representation of the seeds being planted by the company, whereby owning one, you will be part of a <strong>symbolic representation<\/strong> of the future of the real and digital worlds.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Along with their artistic utility, the NFTs will also serve as an access key to the company\u2019s metaverse community, G\u00fcd-verse. Here, holders will be provided access to digital and IRL expressions, live sessions with the team, and other exclusive content.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>To minimize the amount of carbon footprint produced from its NFTs, the company has elected ERC-1155 as its chosen token. Through determining the actual figure of carbon footprint in which the mint will emit, the company aims to plant 146,930 of its hemp plants in order to offset its emissions and ensure the endeavour is carbon neutral.<\/p>\n<h4><b>The Mint<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>There are <strong>5,555 The Seed NFTs<\/strong> on offer (with 5,555 relating to the concept of blessings and change), which became available to mint from April 2nd on the G\u00fcdphoria <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/gudphoria-minting-site.vercel.app\/\">mint site<\/a>. Each costs 0.1 ETH to mint, with secondary sales to take place on OpenSea and Rarible in the future.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Other Blockchain\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"color: #1d1d1d;\"><b>Focuses<\/b><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>With the help of the NFT sale, G\u00fcdphoria aims to become a hub for the research and innovation of the hemp plant, through methods which involve testing out various hemp seed genetics, sampling different regenerative soils, and trying out different cultivation practices. To do so, the company has launched a 10-acre research and innovation plot, which, along with the genesis of the G\u00fcdphoria agronomy development process, the NFT collection commemorates.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In addition to its NFT-centric effort, the company leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency and trust is given to all of those of interest, especially holders of The Seed NFTs. It uses <strong>3D drone technology<\/strong> to map out the entirety of its farmland, where it then collects data which can be given to industry advisors and experts. From here, identifying the best hemp varieties, as well as conducting crucial soil analysis can take place.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37507 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/gudphoria.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"874\" height=\"871\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>G\u00fcdphoria also aims to leverage<b> <\/b>blockchain technology to address inequalities and barriers for marginalized groups in traditional fundraising, as well as support Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour (BIPOC) hemp farmers to produce high-value products and engage with the vibrant marketplace which has historically underserved them.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Roadmap<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/b><\/h4>\n<p>The next phase of the company\u2019s NFT roadmap is the enablement of NFT resales on OpenSea and Rarible. Once 50% of the collection is sold, G\u00fcdphoria will then begin purchasing, processing and planting supplies for IRL activation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>After this, the test crops will be planted, along with the<strong> infrastructure<\/strong> for the processing facility.<\/p>\n<p>Following this, and after the collection sells out entirely, holders will receive a special airdrop. When this final stage comes to a conclusion, holders can expect a Roadmap 2.0 to be launched.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Team<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>G\u00fcdphoria is co-founded by <strong>climate crisis visionaries<\/strong>\u00a0Fred Parent and Jessica Behal, with its NFT project being a product of work by data-driven marketing agency Spherical Strategies, full-stack Blockchain Development and Smart Contract auditing firm\u00a0Solidity.io, and 3D design and rendering firm Virtue Innovations.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Follow G\u00fcdphoria &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gudphoria\">Twitter<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
