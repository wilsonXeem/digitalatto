Waldron is advisor to Dapper Labs, CryptoKitties, Decentraland, and Immutable. Carter is known for inventing Websocket, the widely used internet protocol for real time communication.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cStoryverse is focused on unlocking people\u2019s desire to create. And in web3 that means they can create around assets they actually own. Simple tools allow anyone to make fun interactive stories with the characters they love.\u201d said Waldron. \u201cWe\u2019re so excited that communities like the Apes are diving in to create stories.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In its first week, the Storyverse has attracted an impressive community of passionate creators from around the world. Notable gaming and crypto influencers, including Poopie, Chain Runners, Keisuke Honda, Carly Reilly (host of overpriced JPEGs podcast), Joel Comm (Nifty Show podcast), Big Head Club and ImmutableX have also taken notice. The momentum should accelerate as more PFP projects and stories come online.<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n!function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s){if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?\nn.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;\nn.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;\nt.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window,\ndocument,'script','https:\/\/connect.facebook.net\/en_US\/fbevents.js');\n<\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.the-blockchain.com\/2022\/02\/17\/new-interactive-nft-platform-storyverse-welcomes-the-bored-apes-in-first-ever-community-driven-story\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Storyverse, the first-ever interactive story platform, empowering PFP owners to create and publish personalized interactive storytelling games, unveiled Ape Stories this week, an interactive storytelling game featuring Bored Apes owned by prominent members of the well-known Bored Ape Yacht Club.
