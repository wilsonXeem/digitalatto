Staking is a core primitive of this new world: by enabling asset owners to use their stake to secure the network and earn a yield doing so, staking preserves decentralization and provides returns. It is the Internet bond.\u201d<\/strong><br \/><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.kiln.fi\/\"><strong>\u2013 Kiln Co-Founder &amp; CEO, Laszlo Szabo<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Kiln\u2019s staking-as-a-service product, can be offered directly to institutional customers, or as a staking button for companies to integrate staking services into their business. Both come with integrations with all major wallets and custodians, automated rewards management, and a comprehensive monitoring solution, available through a dashboard or an API.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, Kiln supports the staking of Ethereum, Solana, Tezos, NEAR, Terra, and Cosmos, with many more blockchains in the pipeline.<\/p>\n<p>Among cryptocurrencies, Solana, Terra, and Cardano are among the largest cryptocurrencies using proof of stake, with Ethereum in the process of transitioning to proof of stake. Ether is second only to Bitcoin in market capitalization. The market cap of the top 35 proof of stake assets is over $500B.<\/p>\n<p>Proof-of-stake is an alternative way to validate blocks on blockchains, where validators put a given token amount as collateral to gain the right to validate blocks and collect rewards. Since there are no miners expending energy to solve a cryptographical problem as is the case in proof of work, proof-of-stake is an efficient and climate-friendly way to preserve decentralization.<\/p>\n<p>Based in Paris, Kiln focuses on B2B in Europe. Kiln\u2019s founding team includes Laszlo Szabo, previously the co-founder of tech recruitment firm Skill Hunter; Ernest Oppetit, a former product manager at Improbable and Qubit; and Thomas de Phuoc, who was previously the Country Lead for France at Circle.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"mashsb-container mashsb-main mashsb-stretched\">\n                <\/aside>\n<p>            <!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.8.1-->\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/p><\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptoninjas.net\/2022\/05\/19\/kiln-completes-5-million-funding-round-to-grow-blockchain-staking-platform\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kiln, an enterprise-grade staking platform, today announced the completion of a $5 million funding round.
