The WooCommerce plugin, which was created by a developer of Dogecoin (DOGE), would be an \u201cEasy Dogecoin Gateway\u201d that can be employed by more than 455 million WordPress websites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plugin is free of charge for all owners of websites to use and does not require the involvement of a third-party payment processor. There are no hidden costs, and all anyone needs is a simple Dogecoin (DOGE) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/the-best-cryptocurrency-wallets\/\">wallet<\/a> so that cryptocurrency payments in Dogecoin (DOGE) can be accepted. It makes use of two distinct APIs to calculate the exact amount of fiat in Dogecoin (DOGE) and to create QR codes for smooth user payments.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Over 455 Million WordPress Websites can now accept <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Dogecoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Dogecoin<\/a> using the WooCommerce plugin &#8220;Easy Dogecoin Gateway&#8221; developed by <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/inevitable360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@inevitable360<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The free plugin is now available for download on the official WordPress directory: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/Wm3cYaYBZW\">https:\/\/t.co\/Wm3cYaYBZW<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/Rs2pZqpmBH\">pic.twitter.com\/Rs2pZqpmBH<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cb_doge\/status\/1522632242018750464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 6, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is clearly a positive step forward for Dogecoin (DOGE). Nevertheless, the reaction has been less than anticipated. There were fewer than 10 active downloads of this plugin as of the morning of May 10th, three days after this payment method was revealed. However, it is currently in its early phases, and usage may ramp up after consumers check that it is functioning properly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the meme coin has not had the best of luck with its value, there have been significant developments that have helped to maintain community spirit. Among these is Jeff Bezos, among the wealthiest men in the world, who is a Twitter follower of Dogecoin (DOGE) co-creator Billy Markus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Dogecoin founder, who already has a lot of followers, was surprised to see the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/amazon-denies-rumors-of-accepting-btc-payments-btc-plummets-to-38k\/\">Amazon<\/a> CEO engage in his Twitter profile. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/doge-needs-to-position-itself-as-a-digital-currency-as-per-billy-markus\/\">Markus<\/a>, whose <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-invests-500-million-in-twitter\/\">Twitter<\/a> account is full of cryptocurrency-related messages, returned to the market in 2021 and is already a prominent person in the industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Amazon continues to refuse to accept any cryptocurrency as payment for its offerings, supporters of the Doge community have praised the Amazon CEO\u2019s decision to follow Markus on Twitter. The fact that Jeff Bezos is already following the founder, according to <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/occupymars42069\/status\/1522714227970125825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1522714227970125825%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fu.today%2Fjeff-bezos-now-follows-dogecoin-co-founder-on-twitter-it-means-a-lot-for-doge\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one user<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is very meaningful for Dogecoin (DOGE).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dogecoin (DOGE) has had a bumpy beginning to the week on the price front.
