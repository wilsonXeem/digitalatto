This version is set to be released today after multiple years of development. Burkett said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anyone interested in using the MWEB, and especially those who installed one of the earlier release candidates, should upgrade to the official v0.21.2 before MWEB activates. If you wait until after MWEB activation to upgrade, you\u2019ll unfortunately be required to resync the blockchain from scratch.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The most highly anticipated upgrade since its inception, MimbleWimble will provide Litecoin users with better performance and privacy capabilities. This could create more demand for the underlying cryptocurrency as it currently trades in tandem with larger cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<p>The lead developer clarified that the upgraded wallet has been \u201csolid\u201d. However, there have been some changes as a result of fixed issues found during the update\u2019s testing phase.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/litecointalk.io\/t\/mweb-progress-update-thread\/26678\/359\">previous post<\/a>, Burkett explained in greater detail some of the issues fixed during MWEB\u2019s testing phase. These included fixing the wallet transaction history, issues with the mining logic, and a change in the spend code to prevent a bug with the subtract fee from amount functionality.<\/p>\n<p>The developer successfully reported:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(\u2026) the consensus logic has been solid for a while now, the wallet has undergone drastic changes these past few months as we worked to resolve issues found during testing. The major workflows all seem to be working well now, and I expect most people to be able to use MWEB without issue<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Can The Price Of Litecoin Benefit?<\/h2>\n<p>At the time of writing, Litecoin (LTC) trades at $96 with a 22% loss over the past month and a 73% loss in one year. There seems to be no reaction from market participants over the upcoming release of MimbleWimble.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_489917\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-489917\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-489917 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Litecoin-LTC-LTCUSD-1-860x376.png\" alt=\"Litecoin LTC LTCUSD\" width=\"860\" height=\"376\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-489917\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">LTC\u2019s price on a downtrend on the 4-hour chart.
