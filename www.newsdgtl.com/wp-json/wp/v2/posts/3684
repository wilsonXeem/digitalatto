Prices of other altcoins followed suit as Bitcoin hangs below the $30,000 price mark. Ethereum\u2019s current price has hit a new low in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>The altcoin had tried to pull off a brief recovery a week back but the broader market weakness finally crept in and caused it to dip further.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of writing, ETH is seen below its major support line of $2500. Selling pressure had accelerated as the increased fear index drove investors out of the market.<\/p>\n<p>From the technical outlook, Ethereum is set to dip further and then could stage a recovery above $2500. Ethereum\u2019s long entry point could be at $2500, with a stop loss at $2400 and profit between the $3000 to $3100 price level, respectively.<\/p>\n<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis: One Day Chart<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_490389\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-490389\" style=\"width: 1816px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-490389 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/ETHUSD_2022-05-13_00-41-15.png\" alt=\"Ethereum\" width=\"1816\" height=\"706\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-490389\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ethereum was priced at $1907 on the one day chart | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/ETHUSD\/?exchange=COINBASE\"><strong>Source: ETHUSD on TradingView<\/strong><\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Ethereum\u2019s price were given support at the $2500 level for 43 weeks before they fell below the same. At press time, ETH was trading at $1907. The coin had last touched this price level in August 2021.<\/p>\n<p>A move below the $1900 level could be expected and ETH might find temporary support at the $1700 area before it makes a bounce back. The altcoin displayed a long descending line (yellow), and at press time, ETH broke below the descending line.<\/p>\n<p>Chances of price rebounding cannot be ruled out as the coin is heavily discounted. For ETH to have a successful price rebound, it has to reclaim $2500 and then $3000. Over the last 28 hours, ETH lost 8.8% of its market value and in the past week, the coin depreciated by over 30%.<\/p>\n<h2>Technical Analysis<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_490390\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-490390\" style=\"width: 1816px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-490390 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/ETHUSD_2022-05-12_23-59-31.png\" alt=\"Ethereum\" width=\"1816\" height=\"706\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-490390\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ethereum displayed oversold conditions on the one day chart | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/ETHUSD\/?exchange=COINBASE\"><strong>Source: ETHUSD on TradingView<\/strong><\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>ETH\u2019s price was seen below the 20-SMA which made investors stay away from buying the coin.

Bulls have tired out as ETH dipped below its crucial support of $2500.<\/p>\n<p>The Relative Strength Index was nearing the 20-mark which is considered heavily bullish as it marks an intense sell-off in the market.
