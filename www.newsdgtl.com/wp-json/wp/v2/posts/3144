The next key resistance could be near the $40,300 zone. A close above the $40,300 resistance could lift the market sentiment. In the stated case, the price could rise steadily towards the $41,000 level. The next major resistance is near $41,500.<\/p>\n<h2>Dips Supported in BTC?<\/h2>\n<p>If bitcoin fails to clear the $40,000 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. An immediate support on the downside is near the $39,500 level. The next major support is seen near the $39,000 level (the recent breakout zone).<\/p>\n<p>Any more losses might call for a test of the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $37,507 swing low to $40,029 high. A downside break below the $38,750 support might put pressure on the bulls in the short-term. The next major support is $38,500 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.<\/p>\n<p>Technical indicators:<\/p>\n<p>Hourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is slowly losing pace in the bullish zone.<\/p>\n<p>Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC\/USD is now well above the 60 level.<\/p>\n<p>Major Support Levels \u2013 $39,500, followed by $39,000.<\/p>\n<p>Major Resistance Levels \u2013 $40,000, $40,300 and $41,000.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/bitcoin-price-breakout-40k\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bitcoin gained pace above the $39,000 resistance against the US Dollar.
