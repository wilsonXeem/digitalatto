Investors usually use these fiat-tied coins when they want to escape volatile markets and hold on until the price reaches a viable reentry point.<\/p>\n<p>So, in a way stablecoins represent potential <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/usdc-inflow-spikes-dry-powder-new-bitcoin-rally\/\">dry powder<\/a> for Bitcoin. When the value of the SSR is high, it means the supply of BTC is much higher than stablecoins right now. This means that there is lesser potential buying power available in the market and hence could be bearish for the price of the crypto.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, low values of the ratio implies there is a decent amount of buying power available in the form of stablecoins at the moment. Naturally, this can be bullish for the value of BTC.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-bullish-exchange-reserve-loses-50k-btc\/\">Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Exchange Reserve Loses Another 50k BTC Over Past Week<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the stablecoins supply ratio over the past 2 years:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/HUGzV6MC_b5b5f7d337d54f3f32e44ffd5a476127c19279cb2287c4f5013451e6735c2ef0.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin Stablecoins Supply Ratio\" width=\"1280\" height=\"589\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">The correlation between BTC price and the ratio | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoquant.com\/quicktake\/623b0142e1e3252a49a91edb-Bitcoin-how-to-find-potential-best-moments-to-buy-and-sell-using-Stablecoin-Supp\">CryptoQuant<\/a><\/pre>\n<p>In the above chart, the quant has marked the relevant regions of trend in the SSR RSI (a modified version of the indicator).<\/p>\n<p>The analyst notes that whenever the value of this metric has been below 25, it has usually been a good buying point for Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/small-cap-altcoins-continue-to-march-ahead-of-bitcoin-and-ether-gains\/\">Small Cap Altcoins Continue To March Ahead Of Bitcoin And Ether Gains<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, values above 70 seem to have indicated a sell signal instead.
