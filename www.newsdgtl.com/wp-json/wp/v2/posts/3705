Coinbase <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/musks-twitter-purchase-is-a-great-win-for-free-speech\/\">CEO Brian Armstrong<\/a>, on the other hand, stated that the funds of users are as safe as they have ever been.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the Q1 report for the year 2022, Coinbase revealed the first loss of $430 million that the company incurred.

This fueled conjecture that if Coinbase went bankrupt, the currencies it held would be considered a property of Coinbase as opposed to users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In reaction to the consumers\u2019 fears, Armstrong informed them that the company is not in danger of going bankrupt and that their funds are protected. He did say, though, that if the corporation went bankrupt, a court would be unlikely to recognize user holdings as part of the firm in the proceedings even if it damaged users.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">3\/ We believe our Prime and Custody customers have strong legal protections in their terms of service that protects their assets, even in a black swan event like this.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Brian Armstrong \u2013 barmstrong.eth (@brian_armstrong) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/brian_armstrong\/status\/1524233661997993985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 11, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the terms of service, Armstrong also highlighted that their premier and custody users have substantial legal safeguards.

Coinbase has endured several cycles which were even worse with far more severe downturns, and Armstrong says that these experiences make Coinbase ideally positioned to operate in these brutal conditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/despite-concerns-about-bankruptcy-protection-coinbase-ceo-says-that-funds-remain-safe\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong addressed concerns about a disclosure in the most recent report issued by the company.\u00a0 After the Coinbase report, which revealed the company\u2019s losses, a claim that consumers are not covered in the event of bankruptcy has gained currency on social networks.
