Is that what\u2019s happening? Doesn\u2019t that thesis contradicts itself? Let\u2019s go through the Young Turks ladies\u2019 points one by one to see if we can understand them better. But first, the video:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Crypto Lobbyists Are Writing Their Own Industry\u2019s Laws\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-4y2F5fu1Wg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What Do The Young Turks Think They\u2019re Saying?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To express coherent ideas while recording live is hard. So, to cut the Young Turks ladies some slack, let\u2019s start with the text. The YouTube information box starts as follows:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cCrypto lobbies and lobbyists are gaining ground in their fight to profit from bills drafted with state legislators to keep the cryptocurrency market free of regulation, leading to an increase in profits for crypto executives and lobbyists.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If a bill passes, that\u2019s regulation. Isn\u2019t that what those lobbyists are pushing? Regulation? Also, isn\u2019t everyone in the United States looking to increase profits? It seems like the Young Turks are protesting about the lobbyists dictating what regulation looks like, but that framing wouldn\u2019t drive the outrage clicks.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Later on, the info box says:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cFlorida is the most recent state to adopt crypto-friendly legislation as the state recently signed a law that would make it much easier to trade and hold cryptocurrencies in the state in an attempt to draw investment into the industry in Florida.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What\u2019s the problem here, exactly? Regions all over the world are executing this geographical arbitrage play. Is it illegal? NO.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The info box closes with:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAcross the nation, crypto executives and lobbyists are helping to draft bills to benefit the fast-growing industry, then pushing lawmakers to adopt these made-to-order laws, before moving rapidly to profit from the legislative victories.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yeah, that\u2019s what lobbyists do. Every industry under the sun is trying to influence regulation in its favor. Is it right? Maybe not, but it\u2019s as common as bread. Crypto people didn\u2019t create lobbying.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What Do Ana And Francesca Think They\u2019re Saying?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Young Turks\u2019 bosses did these women dirty by putting them in this position. It seems like they ordered a hit piece about one of the most complex subjects around without providing any training whatsoever. Do The Young Turks\u2019 bosses have training themselves? Because it seems like they\u2019re as confused as the ladies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The video starts with Ana stating the confusing thesis, crypto lobbyists are drafting laws to make sure that the industry remains deregulated? If they\u2019re drafting laws, they\u2019re looking for regulation, but ok. Then, she criticizes Joe Biden\u2019s now-famous Executive Order by saying it\u2019s just the commission of studies. Well, it\u2019s a complex subject, and the Young Turks could benefit from commissioning studies themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then, Ana says that the laws are being left up to each State. Isn\u2019t the United States a constitutional federal republic? Federal means that the States are sovereign. After that comes the terrible \u201cTales From The Crypt-o\u201d title card, in which they use a tweet from an NFT owner who got hacked as some kind of proof that the crypto space is spooky and treacherous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then, the New York Times articulates what the Young Turks couldn\u2019t. According to it, a law presented in Florida eliminates \u201ca threat from a law intended to curb money laundering.\u201d So, what they\u2019re actually against is that the crypto industry is getting rid of AML laws? They\u2019re not being too successful, then, because, as far as we can tell, every exchange in the US has AML procedures in place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-488331 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ETHUSD_2022-04-18_22-37-29-460x257.png\" alt=\"ETHUSD price chart for 04\/18\/2022 - TradingView\" width=\"460\" height=\"257\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">ETH price chart on FTX | Source: ETH\/USD on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/ETHUSD\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Young Turks Think That Cryptocurrencies Are Good For Criminals<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u2019s Francesca\u2019s turn, and, with the eloquence of a first-time podcaster, she says that cryptocurrencies are a new way to \u201cdo corruption,\u201d to \u201csteal money that is not yours,\u201d and for \u201cpaying 17-year-olds for sex.\u201d A ten-minute read on cryptocurrencies would\u2019ve told the Young Turks that the blockchain is an immutable ledger. There\u2019s not a worse medium to finance the crimes that Francesca describes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then, Ana insists that financial institutions need to be regulated. That\u2019s exactly what the lobbyist are trying to accomplish, but ok. Then, she says \u201cYou should want protection. You should want to ensure that cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t used for money laundering.\u201d Perfect, but the people should also want banks not to be used for money laundering, and they\u2019re not getting that either. The only way to stop money laundering is for the financial authorities to do their job and stop it. Common citizens shouldn\u2019t suffer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/all\/dubai-world-trade-centre-to-become-a-crypto-hub-for-regulation\/\">Dubai World Trade Centre To Become A Crypto Hub For Regulation<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Near the end, Francesca qualifies the whole industry as a slow-moving con or scam. As a contrasting opinion, we might qualify the industry as the most exciting development in finance in decades. And as a job-generating juggernaut that\u2019s saving lives worldwide. Then, Francesca predicts that, in a few years, we\u2019re going to be inundated with documentaries about the different cases in which people lost their savings and whatnot. She might be right about that. There\u2019s too much money involved and the average citizen is as uninformed as the Young Turks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do your own research and commission your own studies so that you won\u2019t become a victim. As in the traditional financial markets, laws aren\u2019t going to protect you from scams. Information and due diligence will.<\/span><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Featured Image: Ana and Francesca, screenshot <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-4y2F5fu1Wg\">from the video<\/a> | Charts by <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/\">TradingView<\/a><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/crypto\/the-young-turks-embarrass-themselves-trying-to-discuss-crypto-regulation\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why do these Young Turks ladies dare to speak about a subject as complex as cryptocurrencies without doing ANY research?
