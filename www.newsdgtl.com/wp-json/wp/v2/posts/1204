The organization has partnered with Gitcoin Grants.<\/p>\n<p>Projects will be able to submit their applications and receive funds depending on the Fantom community. The users will decide the allocation, as the foundation clarified, projects with more support from the users will receive \u201cgreater FTM matching rewards\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The foundation aims at providing financial aid to a \u201cwider variety of project types\u201d. Therefore, anyone building on Fantom, regardless of their sector or use case, will be \u201ctreated equally and consistently\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the foundation attempts to provide its community with more power. As mentioned, they will take center stage when deciding the projects that will be rewarded. The foundation expects to encourage developers to create applications with users as a focus.<\/p>\n<p>Even projects with small total value locked (TVL) or low usage metrics will be allowed to participate and could receive part of the 335 million in FTM. The foundation claims that they will make this initiative \u201caccessible to builders targeting smaller and more niche audiences\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The Fantom Foundation also announced that they will be participating in the upcoming Gitcoin Grants round. Expected for June 2022, the foundation will match user donations with 3 million in FTM during the first round. Subsequent rounds will be matched with 1.5 million in FTM.<\/p>\n<p>The foundation added the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As of today and effective immediately, we\u2019re sunsetting the previously announced incentive programs, both for DeFi and Games. We encourage current and pending applicants to apply for Gitcoin grants in the forthcoming rounds.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Fantom After Andre Cronje\u2019s Retirement From Crypto<\/h2>\n<p>As NewsBTC <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/a-race-for-the-truth-fantom-vs-rekt-what-went-down\/\">reported<\/a>, Fantom saw a negative impact when Andre Cronje announced its departure from the project. The price of its native token trended to the downside as pessimism grew amongst some holders.<\/p>\n<p>However, FTM\u2019s price has recovered, and the project seems able to carry on without Cronje. At the time of writing, FTM trades at $1.56 with a 5% profit in the last hour and a 19% profit in the past week.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_487415\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-487415\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-487415 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Fantom-FTM-FTMUSDT-860x386.png\" alt=\"Fantom FTM FTMUSDT\" width=\"860\" height=\"386\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-487415\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">FTM\u2019s price with small gains on the 4-hour chart.
