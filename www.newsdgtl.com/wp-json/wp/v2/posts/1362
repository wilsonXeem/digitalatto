He has flirted with the possibility of building his own platform. Now, he owns a stake four times bigger than the shares held by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Many expect this move to mean that Musk will be pushing a plan to adjust Twitter closer to his beliefs and lead to a buyout.<\/p>\n<p>Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, commented to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2022\/apr\/04\/elon-musk-buys-stake-twitter-share-tesla-spacex\">The Guardian:<\/a> \u201cWe would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board\/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Musk\u2019s buy was reflected in the company\u2019s shares price with a spike of over 25% in pre-market trading.

But Elon Musk jokes aside, he is a strong supporter of DOGE, and his popular events have become a determining factor for DOGE\u2019s price.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><b><i>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/dogecoin\/dogecoin-spikes-10-after-elon-musk-reveals-hes-not-selling\/\">Dogecoin Spikes 10% After Elon Musk Reveals He\u2019s Not Selling<\/a><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>For this reason, users expect that Elon Musk will push the social media platform into taking Dogecoin as a payment option and further integrate the coin. The CEO has already integrated DOGE as a form of payment for Tesla merch, after which it soared in value by 15% to $0.20.<\/p>\n<p>DOGE spiked 8.36% on the day following the news, jumping from $0.1431 to as high as $0.155. After a four-month gloomy downtrend, the meme coin\u2019s market cap added over $1.5 billion in less than an hour.<\/p>\n<p>A day before the buy was revealed, a few traders predicted DOGE\u2019s price to climb up to $0.17-$0.18 after it broke local trend resistance with bulls defending the $0.13 zone.<\/p>\n<p>The meme coin could see a significant uptrend in the following days if the bulls manage to fuel above the 200-day SMA price. Recent Musk-related events might jump in as an important factor for a climb up depending on further developments and announcements, and as the meme coin records a high correlation with larger coins, Bitcoin\u2019s price movement will also be important for future action.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_487539\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-487539\" style=\"width: 1194px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-487539\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/DOGEUSD_2022-04-04_21-02-43.png\" alt=\"dogecoin\" width=\"1194\" height=\"573\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-487539\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dogecoin (DOGE) trading at $0,1480 in the daily chart | Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/dogecoin\/dogecoin-soared-after-elon-musk-bought-9-2-of-twitter\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) had a boost that took it to an almost two-month high after Elon Musk bought a 9.2% in Twitter (a $2,8 billion stake) according to a Securities and Exchange Commission 13G filing released Monday, thus becoming the company\u2019s largest shareholder.
