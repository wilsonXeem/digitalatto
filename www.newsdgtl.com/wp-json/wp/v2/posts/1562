While details are limited, it\u2019s now known that the club will utilize a third-party payments provider to allow for larger, recurring purchases via Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s unknown who exactly that payment provider is, if other crypto token payments will be supported now or in the future, and a timeline for such support (as well as potential timelines for broader support for more simple transactions like one-game tickets). Nonetheless, it\u2019s still substantial news for a league that has historically been hesitant in allowing crypto integration.<\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-size: 1.953em;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\">The NFL\u2019s Opening Up?\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>In recent weeks, new reports emerged that the NFL <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinist.com\/crypto-corner-the-sports-slice-32\/\">would lighten it\u2019s restrictions<\/a> around cryptocurrency deals for clubs, while still keeping some gates involved; while teams could now form cryptocurrency partners, there would still be restrictions around stadium signage and deal-length (capped at three years). Nonetheless, this still showed a signal that the league was warming up to crypto-related deals. To date, the NFL has sought out a stiffer stance on crypto deals, relative to most other leagues, that have engaged through a variety of sponsorship channels \u2013 from league-wide deals to individual team jersey sponsorships.<\/p>\n<p>For the Tennessee Titans, while the functionality of Bitcoin-supported payments will only be available for large and recurring payments, the team has expressed a desire to have payment support for everything from tickets to merchandise and in-game food and beverage. Nonetheless, the move still secures the Titans as the first team in the NFL to accept crypto payments in any capacity. In the near-term, expect major payments for things like season tickets, suites, etc. to be the major crypto-related revenue for the team.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-487790 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screen-Shot-2022-04-07-at-11.11.19-PM-460x247.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"374\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Adoption news has left BTC charts unbothered. | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/?symbol=COINBASE%3ABTCUSD\">BTC-USD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/eth\/bitcoin-steadies-above-43k\/\">TA: Bitcoin Steadies Above $43K, Why BTC Could Recover Higher<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-size: 1.953em;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\">Tennessee Titans Joining The Short List<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>The Tennessee Titans join an exceptionally short list of professional teams in the \u2018big four\u2019 of sports leagues (NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB) that accept crypto payments; the MLB\u2019s Oakland Athletics and the NBA\u2019s Dallas Mavericks and Sacramento Kings are the only major league clubs in the U.S. to make active strides in accepting crypto payments.<\/p>\n<p>Expect this list to continue to grow, particularly as broader industry partnerships come to life \u2013 such as the recently announced <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/strike-brings-the-lightning-network-to-every-us-merchant-the-market-yawns\/\">Strike &amp; Shopify<\/a> deal.
