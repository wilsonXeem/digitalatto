Although there is no official indication on when the Merge will take place on mainnet, it is expected to happen in the second part of this year.<\/p>\n<p>On Monday, Ethereum DevOps developer Parathi Jayanathi <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/eth-clients\/merge-testnets\/pull\/9\">submitted<\/a> a pull request for the Ropsten testnet Merge configuration code, indicating that it is ready for implementation.<\/p>\n<p>The Merge is Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited upgrade, in which the current Ethereum Mainnet and the beacon chain PoS system will merge.<\/p>\n<p>Because it has a comparable network structure to the Ethereum Mainnet, this testnet is considered the best replication. Developers may now perform realistic deployment testing before making changes to the mainnet.<\/p>\n<p>The Ropsten testnet Merge will combine the proof-of-work (PoW) network with a new proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus layer testnet, with a May 30 launch date. It will simulate what will happen when Ethereum and the Beacon Chain merge and the network becomes a PoS network.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/new-data-shows-china-still-controls-21-of-the-global-bitcoin-mining-hashrate\/\">New Data Shows China Still Controls 21% Of The Global Bitcoin Mining Hashrate<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Testing how the merge would work on Ethereum\u2019s main public testnet would be one of the final assessments.
