Therefore, turning to the alien technology in a hope to subsidize his income.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">probably gonna try out nfts, dont understand them or why they are controversial, but cant keep making less than 10k a year and so if there is a chance want to be able to afford healthcare and stuff, sorry if it offends you and please do whatever makes you feel comfortable<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 jmw327 (@jmw327) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jmw327\/status\/1526611810262163457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 17, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Shortly afterwards, jmw327 listed his very first NFT via the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/foundation\">Foundation marketplace<\/a>. An innocent pixel art scene of a small girl as she waits patiently on a street corner. Simultaneously however, the original tweet began to get noticed within the NFT community. Soon, the message went viral, and the bids began to roll in.<\/p>\n<p>By the end of the auction, the single artwork sold for an incredible <strong>20.9 ETH<\/strong> ($42k), amassing in a single sale over four times the amount the artist would normally make in a whole year. As a result, jmw327 can now afford both food and medical care, as well as shoes, Ferrero Rocher and probably a crown.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the crypto downturn, its serves a kindly reminder to know that good things still happen while the blockchain continues to misbehave.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
