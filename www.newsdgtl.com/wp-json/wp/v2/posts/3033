(Image credit: Dreamstime.com)<\/span><\/pre>\n<h2><b>Ripple (XRP) \u2013 Pioneering The Crypto Scene<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">XRP was one of the frontrunners of the early crypto market alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is was one of the pioneers of the early cryptocurrency market, which experienced massive price hikes in early 2017.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recently, the crypto together with all other cryptocurrencies has been experiencing turmoil and stunted growth because of political, environmental, and regulatory issues. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The decline was expected but it\u2019s not a happy state as it is for crypto traders all over the globe. However, unlike others, XRP seems to be recovering and gaining momentum.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Ripple-SEC Legal Battle<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">XRP is currently trading at $0.61 after experiencing intraday highs of $0.63. Its bullish comeback seems to have been triggered by favorable investor and technical sentiment in spite of setbacks from a lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ripple was sued by the SEC for selling securities illegally using XRP. Nevertheless, Ripple seems to be winning in market capitalization from this legal battle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on XRP seems to have come to a maximum point considered as oversold which signals that the heavy selling activity seems to have drained itself dry. With that scenario, investors would normally turn to other entry-point buying opportunities.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/9N26GdVG\/\" width=\"1824\" height=\"870\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">XRP total market cap at $29.76 billion on the daily chart | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">RSI measures current fluctuations or movements in market price to determine whether a specific coin or asset is oversold or overbought. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The technical analysis indicator of RSI with a reading below 30 would mean that the asset is oversold. Investors seem unfazed even with the SEC lawsuit going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Suggested Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/sec-ripple-agree-to-extend-legal-battle\/\">SEC, Ripple Agree To Extend Legal Battle Until 2023; XRP Bears The Brunt Of Case<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><b>Momentum Despite Legal Brawl<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ripple operates in the perspective that it has already lost the legal battle because it has been dragging for quite some time now. Nevertheless, Ripple is unbothered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Instead, the company is confident that they are set for a breakthrough in growth especially outside of the United States. XRP\u2019s expected jump shot would be at 30% in the second quarter this year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The current buying sentiment climbed to $0.58 which provided solid support in January this year, pushing XRP to go above 50%. XRP\/USD tandem on the daily price charts now provides strong support around the $0.58 level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It signals a lower trendline with the pattern of a descending triangle that is getting bearish going for $0.18 in the next couple of months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Overall, XRP seems to have benefited from the ongoing legal tussle with SEC. In turn, XRP has become a speculative asset for traders.<\/span><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Featured image from VOI, chart from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/xrp-price-bounces-back\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>XRP price shoots 6% over the past 24 hours despite suffering a slump of 28% on April 16.
