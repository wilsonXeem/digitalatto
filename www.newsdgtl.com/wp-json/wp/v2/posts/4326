The entire cryptocurrency market was destroyed by this 57 percent price decrease. As a result of the decreasing prices, a snowball effect began to occur, causing other crypto projects to be hit and sink even more.<\/p>\n<p>The price range of $30,000 for Bitcoin is critical. Many large corporations bought Bitcoins at that price. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 2, Bitcoin prices historically consolidated around those precise positions before beginning an advance.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-491273\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screenshot-2022-05-25-at-00-06-15-Bitcoin-price-hovering-around-30-000-is-GOOD-Heres-why.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin\" width=\"1141\" height=\"601\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC\/USD 1-day chart showing the consolidation area.

Meanwhile, significant support has been established at $29,000, signaling a clear consolidation region that must be overcome before the market can continue to develop.<\/p>\n<p>The previous high was set at the same level as the previous low, signaling market hesitation. As a result, the recent $29,000 test could lead to another retest of the resistance.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/eight-consecutive-red-closes-is-bitcoin-headed-for-a-recovery\/\">Eight Consecutive Red Closes: Is Bitcoin Headed For A Recovery?<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Will Consolidation occur?<\/h2>\n<p>If BTC prices happen to drop below $28,000 again, the next support area would be around $20,000. However, it is more likely that prices will increase from this Bitcoin price consolidation phase. The first target is around $35,000, or a 17% increase in prices. After that, prices should target the next psychological price of $40,000. From there, we might see a slight adjustment lower, but in the long term, prices should break higher. This would mark the official start of the uptrend.<\/p>\n<p>In order for bitcoin\u2019s price to establish a foothold at the bottom in the short term, according to Josh Olszewicz, head of research at investment management Valkyrie, volatility must reduce.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe can look at things like the 200-week moving average, which is around $22,000. We can look at realized price, which is the average price of coins that have moved on-chain, which is around $23,800,\u201d Olszewicz said on CoinDesk TV\u2019s \u201cFirst Mover\u201d program. \u201cThis [movement to hit bottom] will probably take at least all of Q3, perhaps Q4 as well, if it were to happen this year.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Other variables, like as the US Federal Reserve boosting interest rates, are also influencing bitcoin\u2019s market performance, according to Olszewicz.<\/p>\n<p>He speculated that institutional investors may be in the forefront of the downturn. The average size of on-chain transactions, according to Olszewicz, is in the tens of thousands of BTC.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, according to Olszewicz, ordinary traders continue to influence market movement more than institutional investors. Those learning about cryptocurrencies are now jumping in during this bear market to \u201ctest the waters\u201d and \u201csee if they can survive,\u201d according to him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Suggested Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/ripple\/ripple-xrp-plunges-to-0-43-with-bears-in-full-swing\/\">Ripple (XRP) Plunges To $0.43 With Bears In Full Swing<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<pre>Featured image from iStock photo, chart from TradingView.com<\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-rejects-downside-at-29k-heres-why-this-is-good\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today\u2019s Bitcoin price analysis is positive, as a dip to $29,000 was met with solid support and rejection, indicating that additional downside is unlikely.
