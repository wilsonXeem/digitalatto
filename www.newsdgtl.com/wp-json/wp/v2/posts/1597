Although debates around this have subsided following the bull rallies that rocked last year. However, it seems not everyone has forgotten about this. One of those is Galaxy Digital\u2019s trading co-head Jason Urban. The trading veteran shared his thoughts on the crypto market and what he believes will push Ethereum to eventually flip Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Ethereum Merge Is The Catalyst<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">In an interview with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Tbo8J67lC8E\">Kitco News<\/a>, Galaxy Digital Co-Head of Trading, Jason Urban explained why he believed that Ethereum will end up flipping bitcoin. The major driver identified by Urban was the upcoming ETH Merge. This merge will give Ethereum another edge over bitcoin, both of which still utilize the proof of work mechanism. However, after the merge, Ethereum will move to proof of stake, requiring significantly less energy to carry out transactions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/defi\/terra-users-heads-up-why-near-may-launch-native-stablecoin-with-a-20-apr\/\">Terra Users Heads Up, Why NEAR May Launch Native Stablecoin With A 20% APR<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The increased speed and scalability of the network will also give it an edge. Making it a more valuable digital asset.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Pointing to the rapid adoption of the digital asset, he told Kitco News that it shows more people are beginning to understand what Ethereum is about. The leading smart contracts platform presents a unique opportunity with its widespread utility, hence, making it a great play for institutional investors.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/gk99R9Jg\/\" alt=\"Ethereum price chart from TradingView.com\" width=\"3278\" height=\"1764\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">ETH price crumbles to $3,200 | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/TradingView.com\">ETHUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cThere\u2019s scalability and things that now become very valuable and will allow ETH to grow and so smart institutional investors are seeing that,\u201d Urban noted. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to create a more ESG compliant crypto and that is driving institutions into such a degree that we may see more institutional money going into Ethereum than Bitcoin because of the whole energy consumption angle.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">When Will The Flippening Happen?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">For highly volatile digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, trying to predict their future value can often be a short in the dark. But Urban has placed a timeframe in which he believes that the market may see ETH flipping BTC.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/mike-novogratz-doubles-down-on-500000-bitcoin-prediction\/\">Mike Novogratz Doubles Down On $500,000 Bitcoin Prediction<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The timeframe he offered shows that the trading co-head does not expect to see the flipping happening anytime soon. However, the timeline for the future is not very wide. Answering the question, Urban said that he sees this taking place \u201cin the next two to three years\u201d which is the \u201csoonest\u201d time that he expects this to happen.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cAs people become educated in the space and they understand what the value proposition of crypto is they start to understand the power of smart contracts that layer one that so many brilliant minds can build on. Ethereum is the copper, Bitcoin is the digital gold.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">Ethereum is trading at $3,250 at the time of this writing. It is currently sitting at less than 10% of the value of bitcoin, although its market cap shows a smaller gap compared to the pioneer cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Featured image from CNBC, chart from TradingView.com<\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/galaxy-digitals-jason-urban-what-will-drive-ethereum-to-flip-bitcoin\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The school of thought that Ethereum will one day flip Bitcoin is one that has been around for a while.
