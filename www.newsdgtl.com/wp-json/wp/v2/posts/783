Of course, this is not an issue for cryptocurrencies such as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/dogecoin-price-prediction-2022\/\">Dogecoin<\/a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/shiba-inu-shib-price-prediction-2022\/\">Shiba Inu<\/a> because of their size. However, smaller tokens are having a harder time these days. Despite the uncertainty of the market, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yugalabs\">Yuga Labs<\/a> decided to launch ApeCoin.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering the current fear in the market, one would think that nobody would invest in such a token. Well, millions invested in it. During the first 24 hours in the market, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/apecoin-price-prediction-2022\/\">ApeCoin<\/a> hit an all-time high of $40, with its market capitalization peaking at around $12 billion. But, why all this hype? Will APE reach new highs in 2022?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin with, let us take a look at the fundamentals of ApeCoin.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is ApeCoin?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ApeCoin is an<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/erc-20-tokens-explained\/\"> ERC-20<\/a> token, meaning that it operates in the Ethereum <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchain<\/a>. This token was inspired by <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-a-bored-ape\/\">Bored Ape Yacht Club<\/a> \u2013 the biggest NFT collection right now. In essence, APE is mainly a governance token but can also be utilized, making it a utility token as well. Therefore, ApeCoin is a governance and utility token. Its main use is for voting in ApeCoin <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-dao\/\">DAO<\/a> proposals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things are getting interesting at Yuga Labs, though. Just recently, Yuga Labs, the creators of BAYC, announced that they are acquiring CryptoPunks and MeeBits. They claim they did this to give IP rights to all <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptopunks-why-are-cryptopunks-so-expensive\/\">CryptoPunks<\/a> and MeeBits holders. After announcing these purchases, they released a teaser video to their upcoming Metaverse called the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Otherside<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So, ApeCoin will be the main currency used in this Metaverse, giving it another use case.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Some big news to share today: Yuga has acquired the CryptoPunks and Meebits collections from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/larvalabs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LarvaLabs<\/a>, and the first thing we\u2019re doing is giving full commercial rights to the NFT holders. Just like we did for BAYC and MAYC owners. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/lAIKKvoEDj\">pic.twitter.com\/lAIKKvoEDj<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yugalabs\/status\/1502420714527334406?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 11, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a whole Metaverse and a healthy ecosystem powered by a single <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/token-meaning-what-is-a-cryptocurrency-token\/\">token<\/a> is quite something. Therefore, we believe that the future of ApeCoin is one of the brightest in the market. The foundations of this project are crazy strong and a single market correction is not enough to destroy them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">See you on the Otherside in April.

However, its price dumped minutes after hitting its current all-time high. This instilled fear in investors, however, such growth is often followed by a dump. Not only that but most of the holders that caused this dump got the tokens for free. You read that correctly, they got APE tokens for FREE. Each BAYC\/MAYC\/BAKC holder (<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/hodlers-meaning\/\">HODLer<\/a>) got thousands of free tokens. It is a logical assumption that they would sell their tokens immediately after APE made its debut.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What keeps this token surviving, however, is its enormous exposure. Every major exchange in the market listed APE immediately after its launch. This includes <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-exchange\/\">Binance<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/coinbase-review\/\">Coinbase<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/kraken-review-2021\/\">Kraken<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bybit-review\/\">Bybit<\/a>, and several others. These <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-exchange\/\">exchanges<\/a> contribute to the huge trading volume that ApeCoin currently has.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We at Crypto Academy believe that ApeCoin is likely to reach a trading value between $45-$80 sometime in 2022. All of this depends on two factors, the overall market performance and the supply of ApeCoin. Having a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-circulating-supply-and-maximum-supply\/\">maximum supply<\/a> of 1 billion and a circulating supply of 277 million means that more than 700 million tokens are yet to join the market. This means that as time passes by, more and more money needs to enter the market so that the token holds onto its price.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Check out our <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/apecoin-price-prediction-march-2022\/\">ApeCoin Price Prediction for March 2022<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion: Will ApeCoin Reach $100 in 2022?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, will ApeCoin reach $100 in 2022? Well, we don\u2019t think so. Our APE price forecast shows ApeCoin <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/investing-vs-trading-crypto\/\">trading<\/a> at a possible price of $50-$60 by the end of 2022, with a yearly high of $80. Therefore, we believe that ApeCoin is not likely to reach $100 in 2022.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, if the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Otherside <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-and-metaverse\/\">Metaverse<\/a> launches sometime in 2022, ApeCoin could experience a surge in price; a surge that may potentially put it above the $100 milestone for this year. Yet, we believe that ApeCoin is likely to do so in the upcoming years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of writing, ApeCoin is trading at a price of $13.95 and has a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\">market capitalization<\/a> of $3.8 billion. Moreover, it has a<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/understanding-crypto-trading-volume\/\"> trading volume<\/a> of $1.4 billion, meaning that it is very liquid.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeaways<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current cryptocurrency market is uncertain and there is a lot of fear amongst investors.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yuga Labs, however, did not take these things into consideration and successfully launched the ApeCoin token.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ApeCoin\u2019s ticker is APE.
