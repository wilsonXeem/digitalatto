The altcoin lost close to 6% of its value over the last 24 hours. SOL had noted a sharp recovery on the 18th of April and it challenged its resistance mark of $110.<\/p>\n<p>At press time, SOL was aiming for its nearest support level of $96. The coin was trading in a descending trendline, which signifies that SOL could continue in its downward trajectory. From the four-hour chart, it signalled that Solana was undergoing a price correction.<\/p>\n<p>If the bears continue to exert dominance, Solana would immediately fall by 4%. A fall from the $96 price level would push prices to $87 and then finally undergo a depreciation of 18% and land at $80.<\/p>\n<p>Trading volume had dipped but was in the green, which could also mean that buying pressure was increasing at the time of writing.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Related Reading |<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-big-drop-soon-historical-trend-say-yes\/\"> Is Bitcoin Gonna See Another Big Drop Soon?
