Influencers such as Snoop Dogg, PwC, JP Morgan, and HSBC have already purchased plots of virtual land in the metaverse for business and other purposes. Early investors have taken the bull by its horn and that shows no sign of stopping any time soon.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, it is still early, and there are so many <strong>opportunities for investors<\/strong> to find a way to get exposure to the metaverse, regardless of their budget.<\/p>\n<p>In this article we explore a just a few of the many of opportunities for both big and small investors to get involved in some of the top virtual worlds available today.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Decentraland<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>Opportunity:<\/strong> District Land<br \/><strong>Price:<\/strong> 110k MANA<br \/><strong>View this Sale:<\/strong> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/market.decentraland.org\/contracts\/0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297\/tokens\/4506\">Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Decentraland is made up of both private and district land. Districts are community-themed areas located around the map, and they currently occupy large areas. As the number of land owners increases, it has become increasingly difficult to buy a large estate (a group of adjacent lands).<\/p>\n<p>However, with some districts now selling off areas to private investors, there are still plenty of deals to be had. A perfect example is this 15 parcel estate located in a <strong>premium area of the Fashion Street district<\/strong>. Looking at current market rates, this is very competitively priced and likely won\u2019t be on the market for too long until somebody snaps it up, as it\u2019s the perfect opportunity for any fashion brand to make a big play.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/market.decentraland.org\/contracts\/0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297\/tokens\/4506\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Cryptovoxels<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>Opportunity:<\/strong> New Islands<br \/><strong>Price:<\/strong> From 0.7 ETH<br \/><strong>View New Land Auctions:<\/strong> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptovoxels.com\/buy\">Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Cryptovoxels continues to release new land opportunities each week, yet amidst all the commotion in NFTs it seems to be getting overlooked somewhat. Prices have been <strong>as little as 0.7 ETH<\/strong> recently, and trades for a well-located plot of land on a newly raised Island.<\/p>\n<p>A bargain considering not so long the floor was around 2 ETH. The current floor on OpenSea is 1.06 ETH at the time of writing. Opportunities for both investors, flippers and creatives to get a little slice of the metaverse at more than reasonable prices.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptovoxels.com\/buy\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37175 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/cryptovoxels-land-sales-new.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2986\" height=\"1439\"  \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Somnium Space<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>Opportunity:<\/strong> Waterfront Locations<br \/><strong>Price:<\/strong> From 7.42 ETH<br \/><strong>View on OpenSea:<\/strong> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/assets\/0x913ae503153d9a335398d0785ba60a2d63ddb4e2\/2175\">Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Ever since the Somnium Space land sale, land parcels by the waterside have been priced at a premium. It\u2019s easy to see why as they offer extra build space (you can build on a portion of the water) and also house the most breathtaking views.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, prices have begun to drop and there are certainly some great opportunities to own some prime real estate. A perfect example would be the 14 ETH medium-sized parcel, right <strong>near the center of Somnium<\/strong>, and with beautiful views overlooking the harbor.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/assets\/0x913ae503153d9a335398d0785ba60a2d63ddb4e2\/2175\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37177 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/somniumspacelandsale.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1588\" height=\"448\"  \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4><strong>The Sandbox<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>Opportunity:<\/strong> Land Adjacent to Estates<br \/><strong>Price:<\/strong> From 1.6 ETH<br \/><strong>View an example on OpenSea:<\/strong> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/assets\/0x5cc5b05a8a13e3fbdb0bb9fccd98d38e50f90c38\/75004\">Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>It almost feels like everybody wants a slice of the metaverse to add to their <strong>NFT portfolio<\/strong>.
