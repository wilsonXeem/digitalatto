Various Metaverse games, such as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/decentraland-price-prediction-2021\/\">Decentraland<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/sandbox-price-prediction-2022\/\">The Sandbox<\/a>, and others, have elevated the immersive gaming experience to a whole new level. It has developed exponentially, with the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\">market cap<\/a> standing at $47 billion in 2020. It is likely to reach more than $800 billion by 2028. One of the most promising, new projects in this sector is Everdome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Everdome is seeking to make a major splash in the market. Everdome (DOME) is primarily a Metaverse game that aims to provide a more realistic experience to its gamers. It seeks to create customized avatars that are more realistic, rather than characters who look more like cartoons.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Everdome (DOME) Fundamental Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The DOME Metaverse uses breakthrough technology to turn elements from real life into avatars that are related to the real world. The Everdome Metaverse, which is part of the Dubai-based Metahero project, aims to reach out to companies and customers that want to take full advantage of the<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-web3\/\"> Web 3.0<\/a> experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This ambitious Metaverse project was launched by a Polish entrepreneur known as<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Rob_Gryn?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"> Robert Gryn<\/a>. Everdome, in the concept stage, aspires to be the most hyper-realistic verse throughout the whole landscape of the Metaverse. Gryn is a venture capitalist. He is also the founder of Metahero, which has partnered with Wolf Digital World to implement 3D scanning technology that is intended to bring life-like avatars into Gryn\u2019s concept of Metaverse.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What Is Metahero?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Metahero is a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-smart-chain-bsc\/\">Binance Smart Chain (BSC)<\/a> project that combines 3D scanning technology with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-nft-non-fungible-tokens\/\">non-fungible token (NFT)<\/a> smart contracts to allow the development of one-of-a-kind meta avatars and meta-objects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Metahero\u2019s fundamental technology is 3D scanning, which examines real-world elements to collect data on their look and recreate it digitally. Metahero has teamed with Wolf Studio, whose technology has been utilized in the music, gaming, and fashion industries, to have access to the best 3D scanners.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Metahero gives its users the capacity to transform almost anything into an ultra-realistic NFT. However, just replicating something digitally represents only a portion of its value. Every Metahero NFT is immutably stored on the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchain<\/a> and is instantly monetizable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><noscript><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Metahero Trailer\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/T-kOuNePMPo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/noscript><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tokenomics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Everdome\u2019s financial infrastructure will enable everyone who will be settling on Mars with them to purchase and sell all items linked to and required for settlement. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-circulating-supply-and-maximum-supply\/\">total supply<\/a> of 100 billion DOME tokens, 5.70 billion are currently in circulation. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Based on the allocation shown below, the token generation event (TGE) took place on January 18, 2022.<\/span><\/p>\n<table style=\"width: 96.813%; height: 608px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 40.8988%;\"\/>\n<td style=\"width: 29.5133%;\"><b>Percentage<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9138%;\"><b>Total Tokens<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 40.8988%;\"><b>Staking, in-game rewards &amp; development<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 29.5133%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">24.5%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9138%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">24,500,000,000<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 40.8988%;\"><b>Exchange listings &amp; liquidity<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 29.5133%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">21.5%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9138%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">21,500,000,000<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 40.8988%;\"><b>Team<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 29.5133%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">15%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9138%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">15,000,000,000<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 40.8988%;\"><b>Strategic partners &amp; advisors<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 29.5133%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9138%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12,000,000,000<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 40.8988%;\"><b>Company reserves<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 29.5133%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9138%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10,000,000,000<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 40.8988%;\"><b>HERO exclusive presale<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 29.5133%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7.5%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9138%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7,500,000,000<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 40.8988%;\"><b>Tenset Gem Launchpad (TGLP)<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 29.5133%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9138%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5,000,000,000<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 40.8988%;\"><b>Marketing<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 29.5133%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9138%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3,000,000,000<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 40.8988%;\"><b>Tenset partnership<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 29.5133%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9138%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,000,000,000<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 40.8988%;\"><b>Private round<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 29.5133%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.5%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9138%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">500,000,000<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Roadmap<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Everdome\u2019s roadmap is divided into three parts, each of which will display a different experience that merges with reality in the digital world. Thus, allowing investors, users, and spectators to participate in the whole process and witness the landing on Mars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With the official public token listing of Everdome behind them, the team focuses on the Metaverse product launch. Given the project\u2019s launch methodology, Everdome intends to rollout its Metaverse in three distinct phases throughout 2022, each related to real-life experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Everdome\u2019s plans for entering the Metaverse will consist of three main steps:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Provide users with a brief tour of the Martian launch room. People will be able to see the launch room using VR headsets or 3D rendering on their computers. Visitors will have access to a GIS trading platform, which is presented during the preview, in addition to many informative facts regarding the history of spaceflight.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Mars-bound rocket launch is featured in the next two phases of the Everdome Metaverse plan. This is more than just watching as people live broadcast a NASA launch. Visitors to the Everdome will be able to participate in the launch by sitting inside the craft as it takes off.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Everdome\u2019s last launch stage will comprise a 123-day flight through space before safely landing on Mars, where visitors will be able to experience settlement like never before. Something similar may have been seen in Icarus, a survival game released late last year, but nothing like what Everdome has in store for its users.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crypto Academy Everdome (DOME) Price Prediction<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Even though DOME\u2019s current price is $0.038, the price could be bullish in the coming years due to the upcoming features. We at<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/category\/price-prediction\/\"><strong> Crypto Academy<\/strong><\/a> try to include everything that could affect the future price into our predictions so that the forecast is as accurate as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crypto Academy Everdome (DOME) Price Prediction 2022<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Everdome launched in February of this year. Its price started real bullish, and quickly DOME reached its all-time high of $0.092. However, it wasn\u2019t stable. At the end of the month, the price declined. We expect that the coin will soon begin to climb again, providing a substantial amount of profit to the traders. Thus, if you invest now in Everdome, the token will bring a considerable return in the coming years. We predict that the price of DOME might hit $0.054 again before the end of the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crypto Academy Everdome (DOME) Price Prediction 2023<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you plan on holding DOME for the long run, it has a lot of potential. According to our predictions, by 2023, DOME is expected to reach as high as $0.73. The average price, on the other hand, might be $0.47. In addition, if there potentially is a market decline, the minimum price of Everdome might go as low as $0.34. However, the price may increase more during the upcoming bull run and exceed our expectations and predictions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crypto Academy Everdome (DOME) Price Prediction 2024<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">By 2024, we at Crypto Academy predict that the price of Everdome might reach a new all-time high, mainly because of the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin-halving\/\">Bitcoin halving<\/a>. The average price of one DOME might be around $0.66, depending upon the market trend. Furthermore, we suggest that it is quite likely that the future of Everdome will improve, and its price will experience a significant increase. Thus, for 2024, the maximum price of DOME might reach $0.87, while the minimum price level can be around $0.62. Even though, compared to 2023, the price of Everdome increases slightly, it could exceed our expectations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crypto Academy Everdome (DOME) Price Prediction 2025<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">2025 might start on a good note for Everdome and reach $1. This year, the price of DOME might be affected highly by the market factors. Depending on that, we expect an average price of $0.85 by 2025. During this year, we predict the maximum price of DOME to be around $1.13. While the minimum price could reach as low as $0.71. If the market turns bullish and in favor of DOME throughout 2025, its price might increase more than our predictions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crypto Academy Everdome (DOME) Price Prediction 2026<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We believe that 2026 might be a bullish year for Everdome. If the market turns favorable, Everdome is set to reach a new all-time high and exceed $1.50. We predict that the long-term price estimate for DOME will increase, and the currency is likely to gain a lot more attention. Thus, our forecast for the maximum <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/investing-vs-trading-crypto\/\">trading <\/a>price for 2026 might be around $1.56. The minimum price would be around $1.10, and the average price DOME will trade during the year might be $1.34.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_25345\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-25345\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-25345\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Everdome Price Forecast By Crypto AcademyFor 2022-2026.\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-1-3.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-25345\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-1-3.png\" alt=\"Everdome Price Forecast By Crypto AcademyFor 2022-2026.\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-25345\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Everdome (DOME) Price Prediction 2022-2026.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Everdome (DOME) Market Price Prediction<\/h2>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PricePrediction.net<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PricePrediction.net predicts that the price of DOME can increase slightly until 2031.

Everdome is considered to be a good investment. This is mainly because of its future growth potential. Understanding the level of technology that Everdome is using, we, as well as most of the market, believe that Everdome is likely to be very successful. However, the main issue of Everdome might be its maximum supply, which is capped at 100 billion tokens.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How Much is the DOME Coin Worth?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Currently, the price of Everdome (DOME) is $0.038.
