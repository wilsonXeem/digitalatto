Up until 2021, China was the primary Bitcoin mining hub. It accounted for more than 75% of Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate and 44% of crypto miners. In addition, while China mainly relied on coal for energy, they used renewable hydropower to mine cryptos, which lowered the overall energy consumption of Bitcoin mining.<\/p>\n<p>When China introduced a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/china\/china-central-bank-vows-crackdown-cryptocurrency-trading-2021-09-24\/\">ban on crypto mining in June 2021<\/a>, most miners had to move to other countries like the U.S., Russia,an a\u00a0 and Kazakhstan, where renewable energy was not an option. As a result, carbon emissions of Bitcoin mining increased by 17% within six months.<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s the solution?<\/h2>\n<p>Enter renewable energy.<\/p>\n<p>There is no denying Bitcoin\u2019s environmental effect. However, to prevent the damage from increasing, there have been signs of a change within the mining community.<\/p>\n<h3>Public opinion<\/h3>\n<p>One of these signs came from Elon Musk, where he often uses Twitter to call out to miners and emphasize the importance of switching to a renewable energy source. Last year, he announced that North American Bitcoin miners agreed to commit to renewable sources.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current &amp; planned renewable usage &amp; to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1396914548167233537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 24, 2021<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>A few months later, he motivated the community towards adopting renewable energy sources by Tweeting that He\u2019ll allow Tesla to resume Bitcoin transactions when 50% of the mining activity takes place using a clean energy source.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.<\/p>\n<p>When there\u2019s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1404132183254523905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 13, 2021<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3>Small businesses<\/h3>\n<p>Another notable action came from a Costa Rican hydropower plant which transformed into a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/bitcoin-can-cryptocurrency-mining-ever-be-environmentally-friendly\/a-60818440\">green Bitcoin mining<\/a> plant. The hydropower plant had been active for the last 30 years when the Costa Rican government recently rejected to buy their energy since there was already a surplus of renewable power.<\/p>\n<p>The plant\u2019s owner, Eduardo Kopper, started looking into other opportunities when he encountered the green energy need in Bitcoin mining to sustain his workers. He immediately decided to transform and stated that it was the best decision he had ever made.<\/p>\n<h3>Big players<\/h3>\n<p>According to a recent <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/global-economic-outlook-tanks-in-february-as-bitcoin-decouples-from-traditional-market\/\">study<\/a>, sizeable traditional energy firms are getting involved in Bitcoin mining. Investing in renewable energy sources that can be utilized for Bitcoin mining presents a unique investment opportunity for these firms.<\/p>\n<h2>Is everyone on board?<\/h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, no.<\/p>\n<p>Some Scandinavian countries <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/bitcoin-mining-is-scandinavias-cryptoboom-coming-to-an-end\/a-57443905\">argue<\/a> that directing renewable energy sources to crypto mining is wrong as it diverts renewable power that could be used to decarbonize other sectors. Instead, they say that renewable sources should be spent on required fields that cause the most significant environmental damage.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Iceland utilizes its geothermal and hydroelectric power to generate nearly 100% of its electricity. EU recently decided to attract energy-intensive industries to the island to take advantage of the cheap energy. This promotion is sure to attract miners to the vicinity.<\/p>\n<p>One of Iceland\u2019s first mining companies, Genesis Mining\u2019s founder Philip Salter stated:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThere are no political or geopolitical risks, the infrastructure is very reliable and the electricity is sustainable and incredibly cheap.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>However, Iceland is not thrilled about the idea. CEO of the Iceland state-owned hydroelectric plant, Hordur Arnarson, stated that Iceland is reaching its limits and have no energy surplus enough for a crypto mining plant.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, energy analysts warn that Iceland\u2019s delicate situation applies to all countries within the Scandinavian area.<\/p>\n<div id=\"revue-embed\" class=\"clearfix\"> <span class=\"screenshot\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"top\">\n<p><h2>Get your daily recap of <span class=\"orange\">Bitcoin<\/span>, <span class=\"blue\">DeFi<\/span>, <span class=\"pink\">NFT<\/span> and <span class=\"green\">Web3<\/span> news from CryptoSlate<\/h2>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"edge-cta\">\n<h2>Get an <span>Edge<\/span> on the Crypto Market \ud83d\udc47<\/h2>\n<p>Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cols\">\n<p> <span class=\"img chart\"\/> <strong>On-chain analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> <span class=\"img price\"\/> <strong>Price snapshots<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> <span class=\"img context\"\/> <strong>More context<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.memberful.com\/checkout?plan=43765\" class=\"btn join\">Join now for $19\/month<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/edge\/\" class=\"btn\">Explore all benefits<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/bitcoins-global-carbon-footprint-accounts-for-0-19-is-green-energy-the-solution\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>According to a study run by Bankless Times, the carbon footprint created by Bitcoin mining globally accounts for 0.19%, which is the same amount the Czech Republic emits as an entire country.
