In addition, its current focus is not on buying new <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin<\/a>. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The geopolitical crisis is one of the main reasons for the delay of Bitcoin bonds. Thus, the Salvadoran government decided to postpone the issuance of BTC-backed bonds. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">During an interview with a local TV station, El Salvador&#8217;s finance minister Alejandro Zelaya revealed some information. According to Zelaya, the country&#8217;s &#8220;Volcano Bond&#8221; will not go live in March.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moreover, Zelaya noted another factor for the delay. As he stated, the Russia-Ukraine situation is affecting the postpone of their plans. Henceforth, he said that El Salvador&#8217;s government will wait for better market circumstances until September.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In his statement, Zelaya added that the bond should not be issued at this time. Additionally, Zelaya thinks that during May and June, the market&#8217;s offerings change. Therefore, September might be the earliest. Correspondingly, he states that going to the foreign market after September would be a financial challenge.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Reasons for BTC-Bond Delay<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">According to CoinGecko&#8217;s statistics, Bitcoin is now trading at $42,236, up roughly 10% in the last 30 days. However, the Salvadoran plans for its Bitcoin bonds in November have affected the value of BTC. As a result, the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a> has lost roughly 50% of its value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Last week, Zelaya announced the postponement of El Salvador&#8217;s Bitcoin bond. One of the main factors stated by Zelaya was the fragile political situation in the globe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As reported, the $1 billion bonds were supposed to go on sale in mid-March. However, in early February, El Salvador representative William Soriano tweeted regarding this issue. According to Soriano, the Bitcoin bond will be live during March&#8217;s second or third week.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/BitcoinBonds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BitcoinBonds<\/a> will be available by the second and third week of march.<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin<\/a> <img src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/1f680.png\" alt=\"\ud83d\ude80\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em;max-height: 1em\" \/><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/e2wL1iBTHr\">https:\/\/t.co\/e2wL1iBTHr<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 William Soriano <img src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/1f1f8-1f1fb.png\" alt=\"\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfb\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em;max-height: 1em\" \/> (@WilliamSorianoH) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WilliamSorianoH\/status\/1491263858987892737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 9, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">El Salvador&#8217;s president, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nayibbukele?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Nayib Bukele<\/a>, first revealed the bond&#8217;s intentions in November 2021.
