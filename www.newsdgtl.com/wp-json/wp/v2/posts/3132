On the four-hour chart, the coin depicts a descending resistance trendline. Ever since April, the bears had taken over the market. The buyers remained wary of the asset with bouts of increased buying pressure in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>Immediate support for the coin was at $0.664. The aforementioned line was a resistance mark but the coin flipped that into a support region for itself. Immediate resistance for ALGO stood at $0.77 and then at $0.80, breaching which the coin could eye for $1.<\/p>\n<p>Traders have responded to the recent development well because there has been a considerable improvement in buying strength. In case of a pullback, ALGO could fall to trade at the $0.560 price level. The trading volume of the coin was seen in green as buyers outnumbered sellers at the time of writing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/five-months-fear-when-bitcoin-carnage-end\/\">Five Months Of Fear: When Will The Bitcoin Carnage End?<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Technical Analysis<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_489712\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-489712\" style=\"width: 1823px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-489712 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/ALGOUSD_2022-05-05_00-54-00.png\" alt=\"Algorand\" width=\"1823\" height=\"709\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-489712\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Algorand displays a sharp increase in buying pressure on the four-hour chart.
