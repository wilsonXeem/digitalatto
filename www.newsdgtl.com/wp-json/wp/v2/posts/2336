The \u201cFluorine Fermi\u201d update will introduce new features to the network.<\/p>\n<p>As the developer stated, Monero will increase its ring size from 11 to 16. The ring size is a term to refer to the total number of signers in an XMR transaction. As part of this network\u2019s unique model, the update will provide users with more base privacy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the network will implement an upgraded version of its Bulletproofs algorithm to decrease its transaction size by around 7%. This change is supposed to improve the network\u2019s scalability by making \u201cevery transaction lighter and faster\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>On the latter, the network will reduce the wallet\u2019s sync time by around 30 to 40%, the post said, and will implement a change to Monero\u2019s fee model. Thus, users can expect to see an uptick in the network\u2019s \u201csecurity and resilience\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>As the update will be deployed via a Hard Fork, users and node operators will need to update their software. The maintainer made the following request to the users:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A new release will be announced before the network upgrade (around the 16th of June). You will only have to be using the updated software by the time the network upgrade occurs (16th July). To the end user, it will be like a simple software update.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Monero?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Monero<\/a> will undergo a network upgrade on July 16th, 2022:<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/9NKlGtqXAn\">https:\/\/t.co\/9NKlGtqXAn<\/a><\/p>\n<p>All users will need to do is keep their favorite wallet up to date, update their nodes once v0.18 is released (~June 16th), and enjoy even better digital cash afterwards \ud83d\ude0e<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Monero (XMR) (@monero) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/monero\/status\/1516835820828823561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 20, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Could Monero Be Spelling Danger For The Crypto Market?<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s possible that Monero\u2019s recent price action is due to its upcoming network update.
