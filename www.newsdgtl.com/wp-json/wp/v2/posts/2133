This week I have something a little different to share with you than the usual numbers and data.<\/p>\n<p>If you wondered how NFT LA was, I have all the juicy details right here. Let\u2019s go!<\/p>\n<h5><strong>It got off to a rocky and wild start<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>At 10:00 AM on March 29th, 2022, several thousands of attendees of NFT LA were waiting in the main conference hall for the conference to begin. It was supposed to start at 9:30, so they were half an hour late, and people were clearly confused.<\/p>\n<p>I struck up a conversation with my seat neighbor, and learned that the first speaker was supposed to be Jeff Zirlin (aka The Jiho), Co-Founder of Axie Infinity, one of the most successful play-to-earn games in the NFT space.<\/p>\n<p>Well literally just hours before that speech, Axie Infinity had just experienced what might be the largest DeFi hack in history: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nftplazas.com\/sky-mavis-ronin-network-hack\/\">$600 million dollars worth of ETH<\/a> and $USDC were stolen from the Ronin network.<\/p>\n<p><strong>They had literally just experienced this hack<\/strong> \u2013 the Ronin Networked posted on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Ronin_Network\/status\/1508828719711879168\">Twitter at 8:30 AM<\/a> on that day, and here we were just and hour and a half later, waiting for the co-founder to speak. It was kind of a surreal moment, for sure, and I would have understood completely had The Jiho not spoke at all that day. He had much bigger fish to fry than entertaining a bunch of degens at an NFT conference.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The Jiho did speak, and it was obviously very difficult<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>I\u2019ve got to give him credit here, it was very difficult to walk onto that stage no doubt, and when he announced what had happened, the audience gasped. He was obviously very emotional with what had just happened to him and the company, and $600 million dollars is a staggering amount of money, inconceivable really if it were in stacks of twenties.<\/p>\n<p>He was clearly very far off his normal game, and the rest of his fireside chat with Shelly Palmer was rather unremarkable. I get it, <strong>his mind was a million miles away<\/strong> from that conversation, and mine was too, and I was learning more about how the hack had happened, on my phone.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Hollywood is coming to NFTs<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Or maybe NFTs are coming to Hollywood, I\u2019m not sure who is bringing whom, and where. But<strong> Hollywood was definitely in attendance<\/strong>, with Mark Cuban onstage, later bringing out Charlie Sheen (of Two and a Half Men) and Kevin Connolly (Entourage). They pitched a new television show which is selling memberships as NFTs, hoping to fund some or all of their new show production via NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>The most interesting thing I learned here is that everyone is eager to break \u201cthe system\u201d. In traditional finance, that\u2019s the banks, the middlemen, the intermediaries, everything that got us started in cryptocurrency to begin with.<\/p>\n<p>In Hollywood, the systems to break includes the film studio, the showrunners and financiers and the like. Charlie Sheen, love him or hate him, is definitely a funny guy.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Me, with my Stone-Age Technology, I don\u2019t really understand all of this, I\u2019m just happy to be back to the party \u2013 Charlie Sheen<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h5><strong>Happy to be back at the party<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>I hear you, Charlie, I\u2019m happy to be back too, but for different reasons. <strong>One of the most popular talks<\/strong> was unsurprisingly \u201cHow to Execute Amazing NFT Projects,\u201d with speakers from creative and technical service providers to the industry.<\/p>\n<p>Many in the audience left for the next speech, \u201cNFTs and Property Rights\u201d. I guess that makes sense, too, but I found it interesting. Perhaps many people leaving for what some may consider the \u201cboring details\u201d is kind of emblematic of where we are right now as an industry. The quick buck is alluring, but the details are rather messy.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Shout out to the diversity of attendees<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>While diversity of the NFT space can definitely be greater, and more inclusive, I\u2019ve been attending technology conferences for over 20 years, and anecdotally,<strong> this was most diverse group of people at a conference<\/strong> I\u2019ve ever attended.<\/p>\n<p>One panel that stood out to me was the \u201cDapper Labs Presents: Women in Web 3\u201d, featuring Stephanie Smellie, \u00a0Ridhima Khan, Jayne Peressini, Nicole Rochette, and moderated by Ros Gold-Onwude. These women each brought fantastic insights and diverse perspectives to the stage, and I thought it was cool of Dapper Labs to celebrate the diversity of their own team.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Key Takeaways from NFT LA<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Try and create lasting value with whatever you\u2019re doing. A small subset of attendees were their trying to pump their own collections. Maybe some of them will have success, but personally I think when you look towards the future, endless collections of varying quality is not where this space is headed. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I don\u2019t believe so.<\/li>\n<li>The change underway is rapid, and profound, and no one really knows where it\u2019s all headed. We\u2019ve all got our own theories, and people are trying to get into Web3 and NFTs for every industry, and for every reason. Find something you\u2019re passionate about, and see how it relates to Web3, I guarantee you can find an angle for just about anything to be Web3 related.<\/li>\n<li>Get out there! Just mixing with a diverse group of people was so cool! My first conference in years, and I gained tons of new ideas, and professionally made some great contacts. Talking to people in real life is amazing, get out from behind that Discord and Zoom, and attend a local meetup, if nothing else!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I\u2019ll see you at NFT NYC in June!<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
