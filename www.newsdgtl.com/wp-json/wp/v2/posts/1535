Furthermore, support for S&amp;G or Kaba Mas auditable locks is standard, a necessity for operators relying on 3rd-party armored vehicles for cash collection.<\/p>\n<p>There is also an option to select 600, 1,200, and 1,400 acceptor\/recycler capacities so that the BATMTwoUltra can serve the busiest of locations. Bidirectional support is available when opting for a configuration with a recycler, opting for the BNR extended recycler offers both high speed and security.<\/p>\n<p>The recycler module enables dispensing banknotes inserted into the BATMTwoUltra by other customers and can recycle up to 180 banknotes. Adding a recycler to a configuration increases the initial price of the BATMTwoUltra, but it reduces operator visits to the ATM by up to 50%, saving on expenses in the long run.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_119669\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-119669\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-119669 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/genbytes-team-showcase.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"639\"\/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-119669\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The GENERAL BYTES team presenting its newest BATMTwoUltra at the Bitcoin 2022 conference<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u201cWe\u2019ve collected client and end-user feedback for years and incorporated it into our latest model, the BATMTwoUltra.
