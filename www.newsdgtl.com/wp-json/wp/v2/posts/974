This was the case during the last downtrend given that these holders had continuously added to their bags this time around. In the more than three months that Ethereum saw its value continue to decline, these investors just continued to purchase ETH.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/research-explains-bitcoin-mining-could-be-helpful-for-us-energy-independence\/\">Research Explains Bitcoin Mining Could Be Helpful For US Energy Independence<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Data from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/app.intotheblock.com\/coin\/ETH\">IntoTheBlock<\/a> showed that long-term holders of the digital asset had purchased more than 4 million ETH during this time. The whole lot came out to a total of about $12 billion that these holders had picked up.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In the report, it is noted that these were holders that had previously held their ETH tokens for more than a year. With each dip, these investors had accumulated more tokens, successfully pushing their collective holdings to a new yearly high. Although the amount held by these wallets has dropped in the past few days, they still hold the majority of the supply. A total of 59% of all ETH supply are held by wallets that have had their tokens for more than a year.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">What Is Driving This?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">One of the most obvious reasons that have sparked renewed interest in Ethereum ownership has been the \u201cMerge\u201d. This important upgrade is expected to take place sometime this year and will completely change the way the Ethereum network currently operates.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Moving from proof of work to proof of stake, the network will not only become safer and more scalable, but it will significantly cut down the amount of energy that is required to carry out mining activities on the network. This will drastically reduce the carbon footprint of the network.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/ZrTm0R5I\/\" alt=\"Ethereum price chart from TradingView.com\" width=\"1354\" height=\"686\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">ETH price breaks above $3,400 | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/tradingview.com\">ETHUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p class=\"p2\">As the Merge draws near, more investors are filling up their bags in wait for what is expected to be an inevitable uptick in the value of the digital asset.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin-helps-market-hover-past-2-trillion-as-btc-nears-48000\/\">Bitcoin Helps Market Hover Past $2 Trillion As BTC Nears $48,000<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Ethereum has now been on an uptrend since this week, meaning the investors who purchased tokens during the downtrend are now in profit.
