Based on an analysis from Justin Bennett, the cryptocurrency was on the brick of breaking above a trend line which signaled potential appreciation.<\/p>\n<p>This trend line marked the beginning of a multi-month downtrend, and its reversal could take VeChain into the $0.10 price point. Therefore, Bennett called this move \u201csignificant in terms of the overall context of the market\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>VeChain is yet to complete its full bullish trajectory into the $0.10 levels and beyond. However, it did manage to score a 90% rally, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JustinBennettFX\/status\/1509160654346797059?s=20&amp;t=3y_kFBX9s8S2dix8kfO0Bw\">according<\/a> to Bennett, destroying the market expectations of further downside:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>VET is the same project everyone on CT said was dead for months. +97% in 16 days is quite the move for a \u201cdead\u201d coin. Let that be a lesson for anyone who jumped on the CT bandwagon. Peak pessimism amongst the masses usually means a buying opportunity isn\u2019t far away.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The $0.080 point will be critical to determine if VeChain can sustain its current momentum. If these levels hold, VET\u2019s price could appreciate further and return to its pre-crash levels from $0.10 to $0.14.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_487218\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-487218\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-487218 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/VeChain-VET-VETUSDT-1-860x451.png\" alt=\"VeChain VET VETUSDT\" width=\"860\" height=\"451\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-487218\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">VET\u2019s price breaking above a downside trendline.
