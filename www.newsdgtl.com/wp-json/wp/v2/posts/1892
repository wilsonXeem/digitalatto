When it comes to passive income with crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi) is the first service that comes to mind. And when it comes to DeFi, crypto <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-exchange\/\">exchanges<\/a> make it much more accessible. One particular crypto exchange that has been a leading example in the market when it comes to efficiency and security with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-decentralized-finance\/\">DeFi<\/a> is YoBit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/yobit.net\/?bonus=UHFVm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YoBit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of the oldest crypto exchanges in the market. Based in Panama, YoBit was founded in 2014 by experts and crypto enthusiasts. Essentially, YoBit has never been hacked. Despite that, the exchange does not require KYC or AML verification from traders. Hence, its simple yet effective platform has become home to many crypto investors\/traders. Last but not least, YoBit is supported almost everywhere in the world, and it\u2019s accessible by millions of people worldwide.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is YoBit DeFi?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeFi has been one of the most used cases of cryptocurrencies. It has revolutionized traditional financial services, and exchanges like YoBit are now utilizing this opportunity to provide users with the best DeFi services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YoBit launched its <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/yobit.net\/en\/yofarm\/?bonus=UHFVm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YoFarm<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> platform, primarily focusing on DeFi. The idea is simple; you\u2019ll be rewarded with additional tokens if you provide liquidity. There are numerous trading pairs available in YoBit for providing liquidity. Users can swap tokens in a matter of seconds and then provide liquidity. The return on liquidity provided depends on the amount of already-pooled tokens. In the natural flow of things, the higher the annual yield, the higher the risk. However, a token with a high APY (i.e., 1,000%) does not necessarily indicate that the pair is less safe to provide liquidity to.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Sign Up and Deposit YoBit.net?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the steps you need to take to begin using YoBit.net and take advantage of the services it provides:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 1: Go to YoBit.net<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing you need to do is to go to the YoBit.net official website.

First, most of the liquidity pools are paired with BTC. So, if you want to take advantage of that, swap ETH with BTC. Next, go to \u201cTrade\u201d on the top side of the screen and select the ETH\/BTC pair. Next, enter the amount of ETH you want to spend, and click \u201cBuy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have BTC, go to \u201cYoFarm\u201d on the top side of the screen. There, you have a list of pairs that you can use for farming.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YoBit Farming. Source: YoBit.Net<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pairs are ranked based on the APY rate. The approach you take depends on the risk level you want to approach. To illustrate:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimum Risk: pairs that provide less returns are usually safer and entail less risk. For instance, pairs such as YO\/BTC or SHIB\/WSHIB provide less yield, but they are almost risk-free.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Average Risk: Pairs with a slightly higher yield entail slightly higher risk. To illustrate, pairs such as FLOKI\/USDT are considered medium-risk for farming.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High Risk: Pairs that usually provide higher yields are riskier, mainly because of the high volatility of the tokens involved. Some examples are SPITZ\/BTC, SIMON\/BTC, FROG\/BTC, YOFARM\/BTC, etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you decide which pair to go with, click on it. On the screen there, swap some of your BTC for YO tokens (i.e., if you chose the YO\/BTC pair).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, type the amount of BTC and YO tokens you want to provide liquidity with. Once you add liquidity, you can access your funds at any time and check the number of tokens you have earned.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24527\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24527\" style=\"width: 2559px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24527\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Farming in YoBit. \" width=\"800\" height=\"429\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/step-3.jpg\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24527\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/step-3.jpg\" alt=\"Farming in YoBit. \" width=\"800\" height=\"429\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24527\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Farming in YoBit.
