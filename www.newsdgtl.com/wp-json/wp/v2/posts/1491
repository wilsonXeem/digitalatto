It\u2019s set apart from a regular Twitter profile picture by the distinctive hexagon surrounding it.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>But how could a profile picture ever be worth USD 500,000? The answer lies in the new definition of luxury.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>For eons, luxury has meant exclusivity, the ownership of collectibles, and the enjoyment of finer things in life \u2014 a first-class ticket to New York, a penthouse in Paris, or a brand new Van Cleef &amp; Arpels timepiece.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>But now, luxury has moved to the digital world, with ownership expressed through NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. In essence, an NFT denotes ownership of a one-off piece of digital property, such as artwork, trading cards, comic books, and more. This certificate of ownership is etched onto the blockchain, an indelible series of distributed ledgers that can\u2019t be compromised.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Once the preserve of innovators and early adopters, NFTs have now gone mainstream, with collectors piling in to acquire ownership of digital assets, and even regular consumers dabbling regularly in NFT art.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The rise of the NFT and ownership of distributed assets is inextricably linked to the movement towards a decentralised Web 3.0, coupled with the rise of cryptocurrency and Decentralised Finance (DeFi).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As NFTs enter public consciousness, social media platforms are jumping at the chance to innovate their offerings. Twitter has leapt to the head of the queue, allowing NFT-owning users to proudly display their acquisitions.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>NFT profile pictures are distinguished by a hexagonal frame as opposed to circular. At the backend, Twitter has launched a verification process for such NFTs, where the digital asset is verified via a linked Ethereum wallet.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>So popular has this move become that the hashtag, \u2018#NewNFTProfilePic\u201d has taken on a life of its own on the platform, as owners proudly display their digital art.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>NFTs come in many flavours and price points, ranging from a few dollars to multiples of millions. This particular display picture is special.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s called BoredApeYachtClub #575, part of the <strong>Bored Ape Yacht Club<\/strong> (<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/boredapeyachtclub.com\/#\/gallery\">BAYC<\/a>) NFT collection. Since launch, the series has become immensely covetable and a signal of extreme exclusivity. Celebrities are lining up to own one, with the star-studded ownership cast including Madonna, Justin Bieber, basketball stars Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Stephan Curry, Jimmy Fallon, and Kevin Hart, to name but a few.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bored Ape Yacht Club <\/strong>NFTs habitually sell for millions of dollars.
