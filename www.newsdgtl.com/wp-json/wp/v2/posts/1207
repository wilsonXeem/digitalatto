Running your full node is the only way to ensure you use up-to-date information. However, we are now officially over the line and we have had enough confirmations to report the news. You can\u2019t blame people for wanting to celebrate early as it is a momentous day. Miners will not mine the 20,000,000th Bitcoin until around 2026, so it is a day to commemorate. Bitcoin certainly is enjoying the moment as the price rallies back above $46,000.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The 19,000,000th bitcoin was just mined.<\/p>\n<p>Only 2 million more bitcoin to go.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Pomp \ud83c\udf2a (@APompliano) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/APompliano\/status\/1509930836417826817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 1, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>There were 3,158 transactions in the block that broke the barrier, totaling 42,043 BTC. It was mined by a mining pool called <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.viabtc.com\/\">viaBTC<\/a>. There is <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lopp\/status\/1509931141838610463\">a debate online<\/a> about which block mined the 19 millionth coin as different nodes appear to show contradicting information. Until we receive more confirmations, we may not know exactly which block it was, but it is in a range between 729998 \u2013 730007 by my calculations.<\/p>\n<h2>Where are we in Bitcoin history?<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re wondering where we are in the Bitcoin timeline, here\u2019s a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Controlled_supply\">snapshot<\/a> of the current progress of Bitcoin. We have had three halvings since the first Bitcoin was mined. At that point, there was a 50 BTC reward per block. We are now down to 6.25BTC per block. This will continue until around block 84,000 when it drops to just 3.125 BTC per block. The table below shows we are in the 4th era. The last Bitcoin will be mined in the 34th era when the reward will be just 0.00000001BTC per block. This is anywhere between 120 \u2013 140 years from now, long after we\u2019re all gone, so we can only speculate what will happen then. Miners will need to continue mining to keep the network running and secure; and there are several options for what will motivate them to do so. However, the most obvious is that miners will own plenty of Bitcoin and still receive fees from transactions. Who knows what one satoshi will be worth in over a hundred years?<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_229219\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-229219\" style=\"width: 927px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-229219 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2022-04-01-190409.jpg\" alt=\"bitcoin halving\" width=\"927\" height=\"322\"  \/><\/noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-229219 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2022-04-01-190409.jpg\" alt=\"bitcoin halving\" width=\"927\" height=\"322\"  data-\/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-229219\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Controlled_supply\">en.Bitcoin.it<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"placement\" href=\"https:\/\/link.cryptoslate.com\/symbiosis\"><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/symbiosis-ad.png\" alt=\"Symbiosis\" border=\"0\"\/><\/noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"lazyload\" width=\"1200\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/symbiosis-ad.png\" alt=\"Symbiosis\" border=\"0\"\/><\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"edge-cta hidden\">\n<h2>Get an <span>Edge<\/span> on the Crypto Market \ud83d\udc47<\/h2>\n<p>Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cols\">\n<p> <span class=\"img chart\"\/> <strong>On-chain analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> <span class=\"img price\"\/> <strong>Price snapshots<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> <span class=\"img context\"\/> <strong>More context<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.memberful.com\/checkout?plan=43765\" class=\"btn join\">Join now for $19\/month<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/edge\/\" class=\"btn\">Explore all benefits<\/a><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/19000000th-bitcoin-has-just-been-mined-only-2-million-left\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The 19,000,000th Bitcoin has just been mined at block #730003.
