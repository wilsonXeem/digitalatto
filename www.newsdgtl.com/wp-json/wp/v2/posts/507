Each HOURAI NFT can be minted for 0.1 ETH ($302 approx.), and can be traded for an iZUMi DAO veNFT, which contains 0.2 ETH ($604 approx.) worth of locked $IZI tokens.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>iZUMi DAO veNFTs are a unique DeFi governance innovation which seek to resolve the innate nature of existing DeFi structures, which dictate that wealth is directly correlated to power. To do this, they practice governance through being locked to iZi tokens, where in turn, quadratic voting, which is a form of vote-counting with a more democratic principle, can be rendered.<\/p>\n<p>The voting power of veNFT is calculated by multiplying its locked number of iZi tokens by \u2018locked time left\u2019. By virtue, ownership of a<strong> veNFT will also grant membership to the iZUMi DAO<\/strong>, as well as rights to staking and boosting.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, the HOURAI NFT series is a collection of anime-style characters, with each being inspired by the different mysterious and Stoic aspects of Asian cultures. They will also have a value support to their floor price, by integrating an unnamed DeFi project that\u2019s backed by major industry players.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Leo Lee, co-founder of HOURAI, had this to say about the collaboration: <i>\u201cCollaborating with iZUMi is a win-win for both projects. Our NFT holders get additional value that is backed by DeFi derivatives, they get to participate in a new project, while iZUMi gets more DAO members that are incentivised for the long-term\u201d.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
