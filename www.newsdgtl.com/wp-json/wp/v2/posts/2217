Here, by playing the game alongside its two million other players, fashion-come-metaverse enthusiasts will have the chance of winning one of ten exclusive Louis Vuitton NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>The premise of Louis: The Game sees players enter a world in which they can dress up their <strong>Louis Vuitton avatar<\/strong> \u2018Vivienne\u2019 as they roam around and collect free and educational NFT \u2018postcards\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, and with this new announcement, we now know that the value in collecting such NFTs is the fact that through their ownership, players now have the chance to be entered into a 10-part raffle for 10 unique Louis Vuitton NFTs which\u2019ll each have interoperable, <strong>PFP-inspired features<\/strong> that\u2019ll allow them to be flaunted across an array of different platforms. For now, the company has simply stated that players must collect a \u2018certain amount\u2019 in order to be eligible to enter the raffle.<\/p>\n<p>Details on the actual aesthetic of the NFTs are also yet to be released, however, what we do know is that they\u2019ve been made in collaboration with Beeple\u2019s startup Wenew Labs and sister company Possible, whilst they will be minted from Louis Vuitton\u2019s Ethereum wallet. With the brand\u2019s birthday being on August 4th, the date will be the closing day of the NFT collection window, with the raffle expected to take place soon after.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
