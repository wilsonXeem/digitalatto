Similarly, a loss is when the current price is lesser.<\/p>\n<p>When the value of the Bitcoin SOPR is less than one, it means investors are, on an average, selling at a loss at the moment. On the other hand, ratio values above one imply that the overall market is realizing a profit currently.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/can-the-600-day-ma-support-line-push-bitcoin-again\/\">Can The 600-Day MA Support Line Push Bitcoin Again?<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A modified version of the indicator shows the profit ratio for only those coins that were held for less than 155 days before being sold.<\/p>\n<p>Such coins belong to a cohort of investors called the \u201c<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/data-shows-bitcoin-short-term-holders-realizing-significant-losses\/\">short-term holders<\/a>.\u201d The below chart shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH SOPR (30DMA) over the past year:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pWfWWONf_b720b5f3a5f3967bb4b0e93e2ddf1ca9acc9b38ce606990d90464d29b8394c4a.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1043\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">The indicator seems to have just crossed over the \"one\" mark recently | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoquant.com\/quicktake\/6257506f48c1e73d9c6cda48\">CryptoQuant<\/a><\/pre>\n<p>As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH SOPR has broken above one once again over the last few days.
