Each day, hundreds of new projects make their debut in the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a> market. However, most of these new projects fail to deliver what they promise, with some even stealing from investors. Such scams have contributed to drawing investors out of this market. More scams mean less credibility in the market. That is why you should always do your own research when you invest in a crypto project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, we will be talking about a certain crypto token, its credibility, and its potential. The token that we will talk about is<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/apecoin-price-prediction-2022\/\"> ApeCoin<\/a>, the hottest crypto project right now. Although this token is trending, is ApeCoin a good investment?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is ApeCoin?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before answering such questions, first, we will touch upon some of the basics of APE. This token operates on the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a> blockchain and is therefore considered an <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/erc-20-tokens-explained\/\">ERC-20<\/a> token. ApeCoin was inspired by the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-a-bored-ape\/\">Bored Ape Yacht Club<\/a>, the most valuable NFT collection right now. The creators of BAYC and ApeCoin are Yuga Labs. This company recently bought the CryptoPunks and MeeBits as well. This makes them the biggest <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-nft-non-fungible-tokens\/\">non-fungible token (NFT)<\/a> company in the market since it owns two of the biggest NFT collections in the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ApeCoin aims to help Yuga Labs build an ecosystem around BAYC. So, ApeCoin will power the whole ecosystem in the near future. Yuga Labs hinted that it will launch the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Otherside <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metaverse in April through a tweet. This tweet included a video of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptopunks-why-are-cryptopunks-so-expensive\/\">CryptoPunks<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bored-apes-price\/\">Bored Apes<\/a>, MeeBits, and World of Women NFTs. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See you on the Otherside<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">See you on the Otherside in April.

Each of these aims towards full decentralization. Yuga Labs and the board of the Ape Foundation believe that ApeCoin will help <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-web3\/\">Web 3<\/a> to develop by being at the forefront of decentralization.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ApeCoin Price Prediction<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We at Crypto Academy did our research and came up with a price prediction for ApeCoin. For each price prediction, we consider different factors that might have a role in the future market performance of certain crypto. When it comes to ApeCoin, the main ones you should watch out for are its supply, goals, and its <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-and-metaverse\/\">Metaverse<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of writing, only 277 million APE are in circulation. The rest of the supply has not been distributed and will be distributed in the months to come. This means that the token is currently somewhat inflationary. FYI, the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-circulating-supply-and-maximum-supply\/\">maximum supply<\/a> of APE is capped at 1 billion tokens. The next thing I want to talk about is its goals. As mentioned before, ApeCoin aims to be at the forefront of Web 3.0. This project promotes decentralization and is working on a Metaverse that will include Play-to-Earn (P2E) games.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, ApeCoin has the potential to skyrocket and possibly do a 10x sometime in the future. Our ApeCoin price prediction shows ApeCoin sitting at a price between $45-$80 sometime throughout 2022. As for 2023, ApeCoin might go higher than in 2022. However, our prediction shows APE sitting at a price of $60-$70 by the end of 2023. Moving on, ApeCoin might finally surpass the price of $100 in 2024, after the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin-halving\/\">Bitcoin halving<\/a> event. By 2026, APE could be trading at a price of $150 per token.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24032\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24032\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24032\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"ApeCoin Price Prediction\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-6887-1.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24032\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-6887-1.png\" alt=\"ApeCoin Price Prediction\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24032\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>ApeCoin Price Prediction.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should I buy ApeCoin?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to whether you should buy ApeCoin, that is for you to decide. We believe that ApeCoin is one of the best projects in the market right now, but we also believe that it is a bit overvalued. Considering how the market is currently moving, the amount of time you want to hold (<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/hodlers-meaning\/\">HODLer<\/a>) onto your investment determines whether ApeCoin is good for your portfolio. If you want to invest for the short run, then we suggest you look for another <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/token-meaning-what-is-a-cryptocurrency-token\/\">token<\/a>. However, if you are looking for a token full of potential and has all of the elements required to skyrocket, then maybe you should buy ApeCoin. However, please do your own research before investing since this is not financial advice. All we can help you with is guides on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/how-to-buy-apecoin\/\">how to buy<\/a> and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/where-to-buy-apecoin\/\">where to buy ApeCoin<\/a>. Of course, we also present <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/ape-price-forecast\/\">price forecasts<\/a> from time to time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion: Is ApeCoin a Good Investment?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe that ApeCoin is just getting started. Everything that we have researched so far points out the obvious \u2013 ApeCoin is a good investment. However, though, the cryptocurrency market is a volatile place and you should only <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/investing-vs-trading-crypto\/\">invest<\/a> what you can afford to lose. At the time of writing, the market is very uncertain and no one knows where the market is about to go. Nevertheless, such uncertainty usually lasts less than a year. When it comes to the long run, APE might prove to be one of your best investments to this day.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeaways<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cryptocurrency market is full of scams.
