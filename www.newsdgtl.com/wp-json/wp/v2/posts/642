The platform has enabled users to stake their ADA and benefit from reward.<\/p>\n<p>According to the exchange\u2019s <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.coinbase.com\/coinbase-expands-staking-offerings-to-include-cardano-e5cb35f7fb0e\">blog<\/a>, this service aims at removing friction from the process of staking ADA. For some users, Coinbase said, this can be \u201cconfusing and complicated\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Per the exchange\u2019s latest earnings report, the platform records 43 million users with 3 million active users per month. In 2021, Coinbase reported $1,6 billion in revenue, most of which proceeded from retail traders.<\/p>\n<p>In that sense, ADA staking has found a major spot to increase its adoption levels and provide millions with access to its rewards. The platform is offering a 3.75% APY for ADA staking, with a reward delivery schedule of 5 to 7 days.<\/p>\n<p>Cardano is quickly approaching the important psychological price point of $1.20. The cryptocurrency last saw these levels before its move into its all-time high near $3.<\/p>\n<p>In the short term, Cardano could face hurdles as it attempts to break above $1.20. Data from Material Indicators (MI) records a cluster of asks or selling orders around those levels.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_486832\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-486832\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-486832 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Cardano-ADA-ADAUSDT-1-1-460x239.png\" alt=\"Cardano ADA ADAUSDT\" width=\"460\" height=\"239\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-486832\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">ADA\u2019s price with important resistance above $1.18 (asks orders in yellow above price).
