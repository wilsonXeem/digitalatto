The outperformance over the past week was catalyzed by the Bastion Lockdrop, which attracted $293M in capital. NEAR, WBTC, ETH, USDT, USDC were available to be locked for 1-12 months.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Avalanche (AVAX) records a 10% profit in the last week with a 37% profit in two weeks. In addition, Avalanche records an explosion in daily active users in a 6-month period.<\/p>\n<p>This metric has been hovering around 100,000 since Q4, 2021. This suggests a growing interest for Avalanche as the price push to the upside. Delphi Digital noted:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When looking at the delta in this data, the strong relationship between AVAX price and active addresses immediately becomes recognizable. It is not often that price increases sustainably without metrics such as TVL and daily active addresses also increasing.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_487131\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-487131\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-487131 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Crypto-Delphi-Digital-860x457.jpg\" alt=\"Crypto Delphi Digital\" width=\"860\" height=\"457\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-487131\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Delphi Digital via Twitter<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>What Could Add More Fuel For This Crypto Rally<\/h2>\n<p>In the short term, the crypto market could see a brief pullback.

In addition to its fundamentals, the crypto platform recently launched a $290 million multiverse incentive program, and it will be integrated with Terra.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The moon is coming to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/avalanche?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#avalanche<\/a> in force, and next week we will show you just how much \ud83c\udf15<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/avalancheavax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@avalancheavax<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/terra_money?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@terra_money<\/a> \ud83e\ude84<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Do Kwon \ud83c\udf15 (@stablekwon) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stablekwon\/status\/1504831483801833474?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The research firm believes the biggest AVAX catalyzer is the implementation of its subnet functionality.
