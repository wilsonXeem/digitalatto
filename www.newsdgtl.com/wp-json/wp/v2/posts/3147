For this reason, the Hash Rate can reflect the global activity of bitcoin mining, increasing or decreasing side by side.<\/p>\n<p>The price of Bitcoin and the measure of the Hash Rate are believed to be related. The higher the Hash Rate, the healthier and more secure the network is, and this can lead to an increase in price. However, this is not a guarantee because macroeconomic uncertainty is an important factor that could dominate the future of its trading value.<\/p>\n<p>Also, many miners allege that the value of Bitcoin has an impact on the Hash Rate and not the other way around as the miners work around the network \u2013joining or not\u2013 depending on the moment\u2019s profitability.<\/p>\n<h2>Hash Rate And Difficulty Going Up At The Same Time<\/h2>\n<p>Just one week ago, Bitcoin difficulty hit an all-time high of 29.79 trillion after reaching block height 733,824. As the latest Arcane Research weekly report notes, the algorithm did this difficulty adjustment in order to lower the block production to the desired level, and now it has never been as difficult to mine bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p>The difficulty was expected to drop 0.07% around next week during the next adjustment. However, the same Arcane report notes that this increase in difficulty has not been an obstacle to a rise in the new hashrate coming online. This means that the next adjustment could rather turn into another increase, \u201cpushing the difficulty even further upwards.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although March and April had been slow months for the Bitcoin Hash Rate, it has now accelerated its pace and risen to an all-time high of 221 EH\/s.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><b><i>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin-hashrate-swells-15-since-last-week-as-analysts-expect-mining-difficulty-to-increase\/\">Bitcoin Hashrate Swells 15% Since Last Week As Analysts Expect Mining Difficulty To Increase<\/a><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_489740\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-489740\" style=\"width: 588px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-489740\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-04-at-9.26.01-PM.png\" alt=\"bitcoin\" width=\"588\" height=\"260\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-489740\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bitcoin Hash Rate is up to 221 EH\/s | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/theweeklyupdate.substack.com\/p\/still-no-signs-of-optimism?utm_source=%2Fprofile%2F8446596-arcane-research&amp;utm_medium=reader2&amp;s=r\">Arcane Research Weekly Report<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The desired level of block production is 6 blocks per hour, but the surge in Hash Rate a week ago turned into a rapid block production rate of 6.45 blocks per hour.<\/p>\n<p>The Arcane Research data also reports a 7% increase in Bitcoin\u2019s daily transaction fees, going from $391,634 to $420,435 in a week. Ethereum, however, still takes the lead in the high daily transaction fees arena with an all-time high of $231 million last weekend, two times the former all-time high of $117 million.<\/p>\n<p>This happened as a result of Yuga Labs\u2019 minting of 55,000 NFTs, which demanded a great amount of gas given the activity of buyers increased.
