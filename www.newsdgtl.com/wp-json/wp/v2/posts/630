This instrumental gap is filled by a unique partnership between Secretum and Edensol. Security, transparency, decentralization and immediacy as fundamental values of Web 3.0 meet safety and stability, menaced in other gameFi projects using traditional messengers.<\/p>\n<h3>What is Edensol?<\/h3>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/3JEwieA\">Edensol<\/a> is a revolutionary gaming Metaverse that combines fantasy action with the use of groundbreaking NFTs on the Solana blockchain. It\u2019s play-to-earn gaming, easy to understand, exciting, and fast-paced. The main characters of the game are heroes, warriors, rangers, mages and pets. The value of an NFT character depends on its level of personalization (special cosmetic characteristics, number of types of pets owned etc.), as well as the frequency and success of the battles.<\/p>\n<p>To sell and purchase NFTs players can use NSOL tokens and go trade on the Edensol marketplace. Edensol includes various types of NFTs, among which are heroes, whose value depends on its level of personalization and strength, gear (swords, axes, traps, fireballs, magic spells and battle outfits), eggs and pets.<\/p>\n<p>The prices of these NFTs vary depending on the value of their superpowers, their looks, their not-yet-unlocked potential, and the rarity of their species. Some ultra-rare gear NFT items with completely unique artistic features and effects will be also tradable on secondary marketplaces in the future.<\/p>\n<h3>Significant advantages of financial gaming with NFTs in Edensol<\/h3>\n<p>A fusion of virtual gaming with NFTs is a confluence of crypto, gaming and money. Gamification of financial systems is disrupting the traditional gaming industry as we know it. It is the next step for the cryptomarket and it has various strengths and advantages. The total value of NFTs rocketing to a new record high of $43 billion in October 2021.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In contrast to traditional gaming, where users play to win, Edensol adopts a play-to-earn model and permits the revenue capacity of NFT, which is proven to be significant.<\/li>\n<li>Edensol takes advantage of the popularity of video games, combined with unique features of cryptocurrencies<\/li>\n<li>Edensol provides verifiable and constant ownership for the players. All data is stored on the decentralized public Solana blockchain, which keeps track of what everyone owns. This means that players, not the game developers, own all of the in-game assets, even if a server is turned off or the gaming company suffers technical downtime. Edensol allows players to maintain ownership of all their in-game items and currency, thanks to tokenization.<\/li>\n<li>The game becomes reality. Due to blockchain technology, Edensol adds real-world value to in-game purchases. Interior tokens and items can be traded for cryptocurrencies and, ultimately, actual cash. When a user creates an in-game account, Edensol automatically creates and links a crypto wallet to that account, which is used to store NFTs, in addition to NSOL and any other cryptocurrency. At any time, players can transfer all their in-game NFTs to their crypto wallets, and then sell them on decentralized marketplaces<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These aspects make crypto gaming with Edensol a source of real income for players. It could be a passive income or even a full-time one.<\/p>\n<p>Although blockchain-based crypto gaming is still vulnerable to attacks. Players can lose all of their assets in a hacking incident. For example, a Discord server by NFT marketplace Fractal got hacked, swindling members over $150,000 in crypto assets. And here comes Secretum as a perfect game-changer for crypto trading.<\/p>\n<h3>What is Secretum?<\/h3>\n<p>Secretum is unique, fully decentralized, end-to-end encrypted and secure trading on the Solana Blockchain.
