For this launch, the brand is introducing a gamified digital experience celebrating creatives and giving customers the unique opportunity to own a limited edition, collectible Gap hoodie.<\/p>\n<p>For this release, Gap is collaborating with Brandon Sines, the artist behind <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/frankape.com\/\">Frank Ape<\/a>, for a limited edition drop. Community, creativity, and self-expression are core values in Sines\u2019 art, which embodies positivity and equality, and aligns with Gap\u2019s values of modern American optimism.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith this partnership with Gap, the creative cycle has come full circle as it allows me to express the beautiful messages of Frank Ape while collaborating with one of the most classic brands in history,\u201d said Sines. \u201cI cannot wait to share the physical and digital pieces we\u2019ve been working on with Gap and Frank fans worldwide.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGap has always been at the intersection of music, art and culture, so we are excited about this growth opportunity in the digital space with artists like Brandon Sines,\u201d said Chris Goble, Chief Product Officer and General Manager of Gap North America.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the company\u2019s commitment to do the right thing for the planet, it has chosen to leverage Tezos, an open source blockchain, to create the customer experience. Tezos uses a more energy efficient approach to secure its network, allowing it to operate with minimal energy consumption and a low carbon footprint.<\/p>\n<p>Available to shop exclusively on gap.com\/nft starting tomorrow, Gap\u2019s digital collectibles will feature four levels: Common, Rare, Epic and One of a Kind.
