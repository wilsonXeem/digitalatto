Despite the recent crypto market losses, APE was able to overcome them. The token&#8217;s performance was attributed to an increase in whale trading.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This token&#8217;s price rose by as much as 10%, reaching a high of $12.24. This was a result of increased trade volumes by 300% in only one day. Correspondingly, the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/understanding-crypto-trading-volume\/\">trade volumes<\/a> reached over $729 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">APE &#8211; The Most-Purchased Token by ETH Whales<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Over the last 24 hours, APE was the most traded token by big <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a> whales. According to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.whalestats.com\/\">Whalestats<\/a>, there was about $57,000 worth of APE bought by ETH whales in the last 24 hours. Thus, ranking APE as the fourth-most purchased token.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Furthermore, the data shows that whales are becoming more interested in the coin since its launch last month. At the beginning of its launch, APE faced a bumpy start. However, it has since stabilized and now trades in the $10 to $20 range. The <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/token-meaning-what-is-a-cryptocurrency-token\/\">token<\/a> was also affected by the recent decline in the crypto market. Over the last seven days, it has lost 9.2% of its value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Another factor that impacted the APE&#8217;s weekend rise was the famous music group <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bassjackers.com\/\">Bassjackers<\/a>. The group displayed BAYC-themed graphics during a recent show in Chile. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Regardless, APE&#8217;s technical indications revealed that it was yet to breach over the $12.6 mark. There is a good chance that a breakout there will make the token soar.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">BAYC Aims to Build a Metaverse<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yuga Labs, the developers of BAYC, have announced that APE will be the native currency for their future <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchain<\/a> game and Metaverse. However, there is not much information given about the project. Despite this, its introduction will help the token.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Given these points, the project is named &#8220;Otherside.&#8221; Additionally, it will feature NFTs from Yuga&#8217;s Bored and Mutant Apes, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptopunks-why-are-cryptopunks-so-expensive\/\">CryptoPunks<\/a>, and Meebits collections.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">APE has been taking advantage of the popularity of BAYC <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-nft-non-fungible-tokens\/\">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)<\/a> since its launch. As a result, APE is listed in 42nd place among the largest <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrencies<\/a>. Its <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\">market capitalization<\/a> is over $3 billion. ApeCoin is also used in a lot of games made by Animoca Brands, which makes blockchain games.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/eth-whales-favorite-token-apecoin\/\">ETH Whales&#8217; Favorite Token is ApeCoin (APE)<\/a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\">Crypto Academy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/eth-whales-favorite-token-apecoin\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ApeCoin (APE) is the native coin of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).
