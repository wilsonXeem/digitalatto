The price has declined by around 90% ever since that. The downtrend may seem to continue in the coming weeks as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, before jumping on the technical indicators, there are plenty of fundamental factors that have affected the price of AXS. First and foremost, the war between <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-suspends-the-accounts-of-users-affiliated-with-the-russian-regime\/\">Russia<\/a> and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-gives-ukrainian-refugees-75-busd-for-3-months\/\">Ukraine<\/a> has made all financial markets unstable. Nonetheless, some major cryptocurrencies, including the likes of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">BTC<\/a> started recovering. While this correction was merely temporary and just a matter of days, most people still consider <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/top-9-cryptocurrencies-in-2022\/\">cryptocurrencies<\/a> as assets rather than money. Hence, due to precautionary motives, people have a higher demand for fiat money at the moment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terra (LUNA) Creates Market Instability<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To add salt to the wound, the recent market manipulation regarding <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/lfg-to-lend-1-5-billion-in-bitcoin-and-terra-for-stablecoin-peg-defense\/\">Terra (LUNA)<\/a> and UST has made the majority of crypto traders and investors panic sell. Terra was one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the market and in the top 10 position based on market capitalization. Simply put, Terra\u2019s stablecoin UST was shored up by BTC (billions of dollars worth of BTC) when LUNA hit its all-time high recently.\u00a0 Nonetheless, due to a failed agreement between Terra\u2019s founder Do Kwon, and BlackRock and Citadel, UST\u2019s liquidity drastically worsened. Both BlackRock and Citadel then dumped the amount of BTC they had borrowed from Gemini and the amount of UST they had purchased from Do Kwon (at a cheaper price).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This led to a break in the UST-USD peg, making the former go below $0.50. At the same time, BTC dropped below $29,000 for the first time in more than a year. Terra (LUNA), on the other hand, dropped by more than 99% within a day. Other stablecoins were beginning to depreciate in relation to the USD, which was unorthodox and fearful for every investor. This series of events led to a loss of faith in the entire crypto market. People were used to trusting stablecoins to at least have the function of a store of value. But, that seems not to be the case anymore since the algorithm behind UST failed drastically.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_25755\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-25755\" style=\"width: 2474px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-25755\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Terra (LUNA) Price Drops by 99%\" width=\"800\" height=\"403\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/LUNAUSDT_2022-05-12_15-27-33.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-25755\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/LUNAUSDT_2022-05-12_15-27-33.png\" alt=\"Terra (LUNA) Price Drops by 99%\" width=\"800\" height=\"403\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-25755\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">LUNA\/USD 1-Day Chart.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Axie Infinity Technical Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Axie Infinity, on the other hand, while still being on a bearish run, managed to increase in the last 24 hours by more than 8%. With that said, since the price is now slightly correcting, AXS has plenty of room for growth, other things being equal. The 20-day and 50-day <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/exponential-moving-average-ema-definition\/\">MA<\/a> lines are both above the price. The MACD line is below the signal line, meaning that the momentum is bearish.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-the-relative-strength-index-rsi\/\">relative strength index<\/a> is now in the oversold region, indicating that a correction could occur. Since AXS was not that affected by the recent turn of events from the likes of Terra, we could see AXS maintain this independence from the current <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-stablecoins\/\">stablecoin<\/a> instability in the crypto market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-fibonacci-retracements-fibonacci-ratios\/\">Fibonacci<\/a> retracement levels of a 1-day chart suggest that if the price corrects, the 23.6% level could be a strong <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/resistance-level-definition\/\">resistance<\/a> level for AXS, given that the selling pressure is still quite high and that this level coincides with the upper trendline of the long-term chart.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_25757\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-25757\" style=\"width: 2474px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-25757\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Axie Infinity (AXS) Price Analysis May\" width=\"800\" height=\"403\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/axie.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-25757\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/axie.png\" alt=\"Axie Infinity (AXS) Price Analysis May\" width=\"800\" height=\"403\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-25757\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">AXS\/USDT 1-Day Chart.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Latest News for AXS \u2013 Price Factors<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides these technical factors, we should look at other factors that could have an impact on the price of AXS.
