Of course, the ambiguity in estimated generated funds refers to the fluctuating SOL prices in which Shi has used as the <strong>reasoning behind the ceasing of the project\u2019s development.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Although the story will fundamentally be remembered as one which showcases the frequently discussed risk that resides within the NFT and crypto space, the passionate community that inhabits the space, has once again, banded together to try and relieve the losses in which many investors may have shouldered due to the announcement.<\/p>\n<p>This has been showed through various NFT projects advertising their support to such unfortunate community members, where offerings such as whitelist spots for those who responded with \u2018NEONEXUS\u2019 in their Discord channels have been made.<\/p>\n<p><b>Follow for updates on the project\u2019s fate &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/neonexus_world\">Neonexus Twitter<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
