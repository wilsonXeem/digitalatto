However, <strong>LWG faced further criticism<\/strong> when it was revealed that they offered paltry rewards to members using its service. People operating through the guild only received between 1% and 5% of the generated income, while LWG regularly boasted its significant earnings.<\/p>\n<p>Lone Wolf Guild represented one of the biggest guilds in the Pegaxy universe, often sitting atop the highest earners leaderboard. Now however, it is uncertain what Pegaxy, if anything, will do with the frozen assets. Regardless of what happens next, its is clear that Pegaxy will not tolerate this king of behaviour, even if this gaping loophole remains open to abuse.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Follow Pegaxy &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PegaxyOfficial\">Here<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
