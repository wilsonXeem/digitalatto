However, the bears are active above the $2,880 level. On the upside, an initial resistance is seen near the $2,880 level. It is near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $2,980 swing high to $2,720 low.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Ethereum-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-489534\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Ethereum-1.png\" alt=\"Ethereum Price\" width=\"1834\" height=\"845\"  \/><\/a><\/p>\n<pre>Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/ETHUSD\/\">ETHUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p>The next major resistance is near the $2,920 level. A clear move above the $2,920 resistance might start a steady upward move. In the stated case, ether price might rise towards the $2,980 high. Any more gains may perhaps send the price towards the $3,050 resistance in the near term.<\/p>\n<h2>Another Decline in ETH?<\/h2>\n<p>If ethereum fails to gain pace above the $2,920 resistance, it could start another decline. An initial support on the downside is near the $2,820 zone.<\/p>\n<p>The channel support is also near the $2,820 zone. If there is a downside break below the $2,820 support, the price could gain bearish momentum. The next major support is near the $2,760, below which the price could revisit the $2,720 zone. Any more losses may perhaps open the doors for a larger decline towards the $2,550 level or even $2,500.<\/p>\n<p>Technical Indicators<\/p>\n<p>Hourly MACD<strong> \u2013 <\/strong>The MACD for ETH\/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.<\/p>\n<p>Hourly RSI<strong> \u2013 <\/strong>The RSI for ETH\/USD is above the 50 level.<\/p>\n<p>Major Support Level \u2013 $2,820<\/p>\n<p>Major Resistance Level \u2013 $2,920<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/eth\/ethereum-shows-positive-signs-2920\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ethereum started a recovery wave above the $2,820 level against the US Dollar.
