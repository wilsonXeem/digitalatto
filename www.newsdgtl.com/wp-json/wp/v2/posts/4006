The game currently has over 7,500 daily and 25,000 monthly active users having a blast farming, fishing, shooting, driving harvesters, and taking care of pets.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Play-and-Earn Gaming Mechanics<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>With the introduction of the new gaming mechanics, players will earn the native $DFL token as a reward, along with a new in-game currency dubbed $GOLDY. Players can use these currencies to <strong>upgrade their in-game NFTs<\/strong> or customize, craft, repair, and socially interact with others.<\/p>\n<p>The NFT collection was received with open arms by the community as it sold out in 16 seconds on launch day, raising a total of $1.75 million. The NFTs have also recently seen a massive 2.5x increase in floor price on the OpenSea and Magic Eden marketplaces.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the new play-and-earn features, players must own one <strong>DeFi Land Gen-0 NFT<\/strong>. The good news it that players don\u2019t need starting funds to access <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/defiland.app\/\">DeFi Land<\/a>, all thanks to the game\u2019s free-to-play approach. Using the free mode, players can collect XP and go up the leaderboard to participate for monthly prizes, including DFL, GOLDY, and in-game NFTs.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Major Success and Future Integrations<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>This new breed of play-and-earn launched on May 18th, and is now available to all users. The game has already received incredible support and interest without offering monetary rewards, so this move will certainly enhance its appeal even more in the blockchain gaming ecosystem. DeFi Land is already the<strong> third biggest game<\/strong> in terms of market cap and still holds the title of the first-ever gamification project built on Solana.<\/p>\n<p>Along with the launch of play-and-earn mechanics, DeFi Land also recently collaborated with STEPN, and plans to explore a multichain future over the coming months, with more announcements regarding chain integrations to follow in June. An alpha mobile version of the game is in development and is expected to be released in Q3 2022.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>About DeFi Land<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>DeFi Land is a multi-chain agriculture simulation web game created to gamify decentralized finance. The game will have all the features that traditional platforms have, but it will be gathered all in one place. DeFi Land gamifies decentralized finance by turning investment activities into games.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Follow on Twitter &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DeFi_Land\">Here<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
