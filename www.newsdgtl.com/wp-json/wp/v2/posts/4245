Privacy-preserving SPV does not share personal transaction information with other nodes, significantly increasing user privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Users also have access to StakeShuffle, Decred\u2019s opt-in privacy system with post-quantum secure mixing. The feature provides powerful protection for the privacy of mixed coins against quantum computers.<\/p>\n<p>Running on a smaller footprint, GoDCR is accessible on operating systems that don\u2019t support Electron, notably the BSDs. In addition to the advanced privacy features, the wallet also has ticket staking with auto ticket buyer; proposal voting; consensus rule agenda voting; basic wallet ops, and message verification.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u201cOur goal is to improve the usability and accessibility of Decred for people all over the planet. Our next focus is to get GoDCR running on mobile.
