SifChain is now at a price point that is above resistance; it may be nearing its volatility period once the rally is over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">SifChain has been trading on low volumes over the course of seven days but it now has an extremely bullish sentiment score and is continuously rising. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many traders are anticipating the market behavior of Sifchain EROWAN as it has become a high-performing Altcoin despite the immobility of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all other stablecoins.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Altcoin Saves Investors From Egregious Fees<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sifchain is the first-of-its-kind omni-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) geared towards digital assets and altcoins that enables liquidity, freeing investors from ridiculous trading fees and immature trades. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sifchain has set eyes on roughly 20 to 25 blockchains to facilitate cross-chain integrations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/fS1AwguH\/\" width=\"1834\" height=\"818\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Crypto total market cap at $1.84 trillion on the weekend chart | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The only way for DAOs to be self-subsistent is to get their hands on enormous funding. <\/span>Enabling cross-chain liquidity is important for continuity in the blockhain space.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sifchain is from the Cosmos Software Development Kit (SDK) and runs along others like Akash, Kava, and Terra in the Cosmos Network Blockchain network.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>EROWAN \u2013 100x More Powerful Than ETH-Based DEXs<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With that being said, EROWAN is 100 times more powerful and robust compared to Ethereum-based DEXs when considering transaction speed and trading fees. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a DEX, Sifchain has the best of worlds in terms of order books and liquidity pools enabling solid order execution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Users are bound to leave a protocol once the APYs plunge which makes it very difficult to maintain its liquidity. Majority of protocols incentivize liquidity by way of annual percentage yields of APYs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Suggested Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/dogecoin-doge-struggles-drops-9\/\">Dogecoin (DOGE) Struggles, Drops 9% After Elon Musk Twitter Buyout<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now, the problem with keeping the APYs relatively high is that it results in casting aside the native token price. PMPT is the solution to this dilemma.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PMTP\u2019s goal is to pump up the ROWAN value so that the community would be encouraged to HODL which will beef up ROWAN liquidity for the long term. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To do this, the ROWAN exchange rate is adjusted by small increments on the Sifchain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PMTP applies every time you swap.
