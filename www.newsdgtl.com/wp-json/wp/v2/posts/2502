This is possible due to blockchain technology \u2013 which stores and secures crypto assets using a <strong>peer-to-peer network<\/strong> of connected computers, which are also known as nodes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using an algorithmically generated string of codes, blockchain is able to figure out which assets belong to you. When you sign up to set up a crypto wallet, algorithmic codes of 12-24 simple words like (\u201ccrop\u201d, \u201cplant,\u201d \u201charmony,\u201d \u201cpress,\u201d \u201cstand,\u201d \u201cclick\u201d) are generated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>These generated simple words, known as the \u201crecovery phase\u201d or \u201cseed phrase,\u201d are used to unlock your wallet anytime, and they are not to be shared with anyone except \u201cyour next of kin\u201d or \u201cheir\u201d. Private keys are created in the wallet, using these seed phrases in order to allow you to send or receive your assets.<\/p>\n<p>Reductively, imagine the wallet as the password manager and the seed phrase as the master password to access it.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned earlier, <strong>the seed phrase must not be shared with anyone<\/strong>; thus, keeping it safe is important; otherwise, anyone with access to your crypto phrase can gain access and control of your crypto assets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happens if you can\u2019t recollect your seed phrase and your wallet is deleted? It is simple; your crypto is gone forever. This is more than enough reason to safeguard your seed phrase properly and securely, so we will take a look at several ways you can keep it safe and protected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before this, it is of importance to have these two key points in the back of your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The seed phrase must be copied word for word exactly as it is displayed in the wallet. A single mistake in any of the alphabet is enough to make you lose your entire crypto assets.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offline storage is the best. Your seed phrase should not be stored on a computer, phone, or any device connected to the Internet.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Now let us have a look at how you store your seed phrase.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering the total power control that anyone who possesses your recovery seed will have over your assets, how you record and preserve it is very important. Furthermore, since a seed phrase is to be readily available wherever and whenever you need it, keeping it somewhere safe but easily accessible is essential. Below are some of the ways to save your phrase securely.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Seed Phrase Splitting<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although powerful, this method is not a friendly one. It involves splitting your seed phrase between different sections in multiple different locations. With this method, cybercriminals are kept at bay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steel plates and capsules (a major example are the Cryptosteel capsule and Blindfodl steel plate) make it simple and secure to physically store your seed phrase or split seed phrases.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>How does it work?<\/strong> A steel capsule works by using both character and separator plates to separate each word of your seed phrase, then locks them in place with a thick thread that connects the capsule\u2019s shell and core.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Hard Drives<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike the Cryptosteel capsule and steel, which may not be readily available, hard drives are readily available almost everywhere and are economical. Storing your seed phrase on hard drives may look cheap, but they are not secure as it may easily contact computer viruses which may then restrict your access to your seed phrase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another limitation is that it may fall into the hands of a criminal, and they can quickly obtain your <strong>seed phrase<\/strong> by plugging the drive into any laptop or computer. However, you could spread the seed phrase across two or more drives to make it more difficult to access, but they will still be easy to infiltrate once discovered.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Paper Storage<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to preserve your seed phrase is to write it out on paper. However, keeping your entire phrase on a single piece of paper in an easily accessible location in your home is not a good idea. If you want to make use of this method, it is advisable to make use of splitting the seed phrase and spread it over <strong>numerous secure hiding places<\/strong> in the home and the places should be out of reach from visitors, little kids, and even your pets.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Paraphrasing<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are a wordsmith, you may consider saving your seed phrase on a paper by <strong>paraphrasing<\/strong> them or using synonyms alike or homophonic words similar to them. This will keep anybody with access to it at bay and not understand your scope.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Storage Options to Avoid<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although not all of the strategies highlighted above will work for everyone, you should bear in mind that the more obscure, the better. Below are some of the things you should stay clear of:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not take pictures or snapshots of your seed phrase<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not store your seed phrase in a password manager<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not use any service claiming to be a recovery platform for your phrase<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind that the more time and effort you put into correctly preserving and maintaining your seed phrase, the safer your funds will be for you and your loved ones. It is then advisable to combine two or more of the strategies or methods highlighted above.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
