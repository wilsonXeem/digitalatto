It had risen to its all-time high back in 2021 when the bull market was in full bloom. It then continued to maintain on the high spike, spiking at various intervals to high points. At its highest, average ETH gas fees were as high as $69. However, with the recent downtrend and the market losing momentum, the gas fees have crumbled and the recent decline has seen its near six-month lows.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Ethereum Fees Are Down<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Ethereum gas fees for the last three months showed a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bitinfocharts.com\/comparison\/ethereum-transactionfees.html#6m\">consistent downtrend<\/a> that saw average gas fees decline as low as $5.98 in early March. This had been the lowest that gas fees had been in seven months at this point. However, a spike in gas fees in early April would quickly put an end to this sending gas fees as high as $43 once more. This would prove to be only temporary given that the sharp downtrend that followed has sent ETH gas fees to plummet towards six-month lows.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/all\/defi-stablecoin-platform-beanstalk-suffers-80m-hack\/\">DeFi Stablecoin Platform Beanstalk Suffers ~$80M Hack<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">As of Monday, Ethereum gas fees had declined as low as $8.78 on average. It represented a 76$% drop from its April high to put it in levels recorded in early March. The drop in ETH fees has also translated to a drop in the fees of Layer 2 rollups which boast significantly lesser fees than it costs to transact on the main network.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The lowest recorded fee rate had dropped to as low as $0.03 per transaction on Sunday recorded on Metis Network.

Ethereum price had crashed below $3,000 in the early hours of Monday, and while small recoveries were made, various dips saw the digital asset touch the $2,800 price range before the opening of the markets on Monday.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/eth\/ethereum-slides-below-3k\/\">TA: Ethereum Slides Below 3K, Why Bears Could Aim $2.5K<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">With selloffs rocking the market, indicators had turned inherently bullish for the digital asset, skewing completely in favor of the sellers. After breaking the $3,000 mark, the next major support level now lies at $2,900 although bears continue their efforts to drag it down lower.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">ETH has now fallen below the 50-day moving average. This puts the short-term forecasts of the cryptocurrency right in the negative for the majority of traders, and the long-term outlook is not looking good either.
