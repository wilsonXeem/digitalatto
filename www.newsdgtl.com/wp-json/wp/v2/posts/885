These short traders that obviously expected the previous market trend of low momentum to continue have now incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in losses in the crypto market, and in a very short time too. The bloodbath has not eased up either since bitcoin is still firm in its recovery trend.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Bitcoin Traders Get Rekt<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Bitcoin had been on a slow but steady recovery trend over the past week. However, the weekend would quickly put a stop to this slow trend as the digital asset had surged drastically on Sunday night. This trend continued into Monday, seeing the cryptocurrency break the $47,000 price level, setting a three-month high record for bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin-retakes-robust-position\/\">Bitcoin Retakes Robust Position As Price Nears $45,000<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">This increase in price had seen short traders liquidated almost immediately. These traders who had millions in the market riding on bitcoin continue to fall would see themselves lose millions before the trading market open on Monday.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-486987 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/btc-liquidations-1-460x58.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin liquidations\" width=\"460\" height=\"58\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC liquidations reach $169 million | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.coinglass.com\/LiquidationData\">Coinglass<\/a><\/pre>\n<p class=\"p2\">As usual, bitcoin led the pack in terms of liquidation losses. The digital asset saw tens of millions of shorts liquidated in just a matter of minutes following the price surge. In total, there have been more than $60 million in shorts liquidated in the past 12 hours as of the time of writing. On the 24-hour scale, the numbers are even grimmer given that more than $169 million in liquidations have been recorded.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Liquidations Rock Crypto Market<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">On a broader scale, a lot of crypto traders have been burned in just the last 24 hours ago. Most notable was when the price of bitcoin had successfully broken past $45,000. This point is where bears mounted significant resistance and it was expected it will fall once again from this point like it has the past three months. But traders would bear the brunt of this given that over $100 million in BTC and ETH shorts were liquidated in a mere five minutes after this.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/SqDwntcz\/\" alt=\"Bitcoin price chart from TradingView.com\" width=\"1354\" height=\"686\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC surges past $47,000 | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/TradingView.com\">BTCUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p class=\"p2\">Data from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.coinglass.com\/LiquidationData\">Coinglass<\/a> shows that over $187 worth of liquidations has been recorded in the crypto market in the last 12 hours.
