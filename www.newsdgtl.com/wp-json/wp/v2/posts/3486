The launch of the mainnet brings along three major advancements on the platform, named \u201ccubes\u201d, enabling users to adjust to the Hyperdex network and unlock its vast capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Going live on Wednesday, the Hyperdex mainnet will introduce the Fixed Income, Algo Trading, and Race Trading cubes, adding to a plethora of features available including token swaps, liquidity provision &amp; staking. According to a team statement, the three \u201ccubes\u201d will be the first phase of investment development and strategies integrated into the platform, with more to follow in the coming months.<\/p>\n<p>First, the Fixed Income strategy employs a low-risk strategy that enables them to earn a fixed return on their stablecoins and crypto-assets over a specific period of time. The Fixed Income cubes each offer different rates of return and details pertaining to the investment.<\/p>\n<p>Second, the Algo Trading cubes is a moderate risk strategy that enables users to earn a variable return on their crypto assets. The strategies are based on statistics, with a multidimensional approach stemming from but not limited to arbitrage.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the Race Trading cube is Hyperdex\u2019s flagship product, offering DeFi users high-risk strategies that allow users to take derivative-like positions on their crypto assets on a decentralized and secure platform. Race Trading Cubes take a relatively more aggressive approach to investing, with users able to speculate on the future price of an asset by selecting long or short positions. The strategies offer a wide variety of Cubes with different assets, target prices, liquidation prices, leverage, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the Race Trading cube is built for all users, whether amateur or pro traders, with Hyperdex controlling every complicated component of what is essentially a derivatives contract. Traders on Race Trading will only need to press a few clicks on the platform to start trading derivatives, similar to the convenience of a centralized exchange.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cHyperdex was designed to drive down the complexity of DeFi investment, and to give users exposure to sophisticated products that were once the preserve of pros,\u201d explains Manfredi Magris, Hyperdex Co-Founder. \u201cOur Race Trading cube, for example, contains a simplified derivatives contract that makes it easy for anyone to experience the rewards of decentralized finance, all boosted by the HYP token.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Hyperdex launches $HYP on IDO<\/h3>\n<p>Once the mainnet launches, Hyperdex will launch its native utility token, $HYP, via an initial DEX offering (IDO) and issued it to private investors. The $HYP token can be used to boost liquidity provision (LP) rewards available to users of the Hyperdex platform and to incentivize the deployment of automated trading strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the launch of the Hyperdex mainnet kicks off a path to build the platform according to its ambitious roadmap. In the coming weeks, the team plans to introduce more sophisticated \u2018Hypercubes\u2019 that boost the investors\u2019 returns two-fold and launch a P2P loan exchange.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/company\/hyperdex-launches-mainnet-to-introduce-advanced-trading-features-for-defi-users\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hyperdex, a Swiss-based decentralized exchange (DEX), announced its mainnet is finally going live following the successful period of its testnet.
