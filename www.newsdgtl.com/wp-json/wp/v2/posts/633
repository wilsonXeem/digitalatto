Governments, shareholders, employees and consumers all want businesses to make environmental concerns integral to their decision-making. In fact, research from IBM\u2019s <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/thought-leadership\/institute-business-value\/\">Institute for Business Value (IBV)<\/a> finds that 50% of consumers say they\u2019re <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/thought-leadership\/institute-business-value\/report\/2022-consumer-study\">willing to pay a premium for sustainable brands<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But there\u2019s an evident gap between good intentions and meaningful action: In the same IBV study, fewer than one in three consumers report that sustainable products made up more than half of their last purchase. There\u2019s a gap on the business side too: only 35% of surveyed businesses have acted on their strategies in this area.<\/p>\n<p>But what if digital business transformation could go hand in hand with sustainability transformation? For the new report <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/thought-leadership\/institute-business-value\/report\/sustainability-transformation?lnk=ushpv18f4\">\u201cSustainability as a transformative catalyst,\u201d<\/a>\u00a0the IBV surveyed 1,958\u00a0executives\u00a0across a variety of manufacturing-oriented industries in 32 countries. As the study found, by integrating their sustainability and digital transformation efforts, a small group of \u201ctransformative trailblazers\u201d has emerged.<\/p>\n<p>These firms demonstrate how to narrow the gap between intent and action, outperforming on innovation while achieving better sustainability outcomes and revenue growth. Between 2018 and the first half of 2021, these firms saw an estimated cumulative revenue growth of 51% \u2014 a difference of nine percentage points over their next-best-performing peers.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"ibm-h3\">Only 39% of firms are developing more energy-efficient products and services<\/h3>\n<p>The increase in government regulation and rise in consumer expectations around sustainability make it clear: organizations today must consider the environmental impact of their activities at every level. And the changes they make must also be factored into pricing.<\/p>\n<p>But trailblazers aside, many are not ready to do this. While half of the firms surveyed have initiatives in place to improve\u00a0sustainability reporting, less than\u00a0half indicate that they are willing to change existing business practices at the expense of profits. And only 39% of companies are\u00a0developing\u00a0more\u00a0energy-efficient products and services.<\/p>\n<p>Even so, businesses are aware that solutions are out there, and organizations often state that they have the technological solutions to achieve sustainability. Executives cite mobile,\u00a0Internet of Things (IoT),\u00a0cloud technologies\u00a0and AI as essential\u00a0to achieving sustainability goals. The issue lies with implementation.<\/p>\n<p>This is where the \u201ctransformative trailblazers\u201d come in. By\u00a0integrating their sustainability and digital transformation efforts, these firms are using sustainability to differentiate themselves\u00a0in the marketplace and create business value.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"ibm-h3\">Key traits of transformational trailblazers<\/h3>\n<p>Transformative trailblazers share several features. First, they understand that sustainability is fundamentally a business transformation play, driving change and innovation. They are therefore significantly more\u00a0likely\u00a0to take\u00a0advantage of emerging technologies such as AI, hybrid cloud and blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, these firms regard sustainability not as an \u201cadd-on\u201d but as a strategy to infuse into the core fabric of the organization. Technology is central to achieving these initiatives, which means the CIO\u00a0has a central role to play. In fact, at these firms the CIO frequently shares responsibility for\u00a0the sustainability agenda with the COO, helping the business integrate sustainability and digital transformation operationally as well as in their corporate governance.<\/p>\n<p>Transformational trailblazers also step outside their organizations to collaborate closely with ecosystems and supply chains, working closely with business partners to achieve their sustainability goals together.<\/p>\n<p>One case in point is electric utility multinational <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/case-studies\/iberdrola\/?lnk=eshpv18cs1\">Iberdrola<\/a>. As part of its commitment to achieving carbon neutrality globally by 2050, the company needed to ensure\u00a0that 70% of its core suppliers will implement effective sustainable development policies and standards by\u00a02022.<\/p>\n<p>Working in partnership with IBM and SAP, Iberdrola <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/case-studies\/iberdrola\/?lnk=eshpv18cs1\">successfully implemented buying protocols and catalogs of pre-approved products and services in its procurement processes<\/a>. As a result, the company\u00a0can verify\u00a0that each department makes purchases at a unified price and follows the correct contract conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, for suppliers that don\u2019t meet Iberdrola\u2019s sustainability objectives initially, the scoring tool is used to provide a clear set of actions to improve their business model\u00a0sustainability.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"ibm-h3\">Listening to employees and customers is key to achieving sustainability success<\/h3>\n<p>Engaging with ecosystems and supply chains is crucial to the success of transformational trailblazers, but there is another important component: listening.<\/p>\n<p>The IBV found that businesses that engage employees and customers receive crucial input for shaping their sustainability agenda. Nobody has a monopoly on good ideas, so being open to many opinions can help firms identify the best opportunities for innovative new products and services.<\/p>\n<p>Achieving sustainability isn\u2019t easy. But there is a path forward. Those who understand that sustainability and business transformation go hand in hand are well positioned to become leaders within their industries.<\/p>\n<p><em>In this radically changed business landscape, IBM is partnering with organizations to deliver five levers of digital advantage that are designed to<\/em><em> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/ibm.com\/analytics\">predict<\/a><\/em><em> and shape data-driven outcomes, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/ibm.com\/automation\">automate<\/a><\/em><em> at scale for productivity and efficiency, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/ibm.com\/security\">secure<\/a><\/em><em> all touchpoints all the time, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/ibm.com\/cloud\/hybrid\">modernize<\/a><\/em><em> infrastructures and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/consulting\/\">transform<\/a><\/em><em> with new technology-driven digital business models.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>For a deep dive into how you can achieve business and sustainability success, read the IBV\u2019s full report, <\/em><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/thought-leadership\/institute-business-value\/report\/sustainability-transformation?lnk=ushpv18f4\"><em>\u201c<\/em><em>Sustainability as a transformative catalyst.\u201d<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>Learn more about <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/ca-en\/campaign\/sustainability\">how sustainability can become part of your transformation strategy<\/a>. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/ibv\">IBM Institute for Business Value<\/a> delivers thought leadership and insights to drive business value.<\/em><\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p><script>(function(d, s, id) {\n          var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n          if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n          js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;\n          js.src = \"\/\/connect.facebook.net\/en_US\/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.4\";\n          fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\n        }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));<\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/blogs\/blockchain\/2022\/02\/digital-transformation-sustainability-ibv\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Share this post: It\u2019s past time for businesses to get serious about their sustainability efforts.
