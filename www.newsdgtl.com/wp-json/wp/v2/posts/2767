It could help keep track \u2014 and verify the ownership \u2014 of goods sold internationally. It could vastly improve payments, making them available 24\/7 to more people and at lower cost, particularly for the smaller, frequent transactions undertaken by migrant workers.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, Dudley went on to say that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201ca desirable future for digital finance requires prudent regulation.\u201d <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He condoned the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/biden-to-issue-crypto-executive-order\/\">executive order issued by Joe Biden, the President of the United States,<\/a> but he still does not think that it is quite <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cenough to ensure that action is taken before the industry\u2019s unfettered growth generates significant disruptions and losses.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the lack of knowledge and a divided regulatory system that splits authority between the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/tesla-held-2-billion-btc-2021\/\">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)<\/a>, the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/former-cftc-chair-says-crypto-is-not-part-of-sec-jurisdiction\/\">Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)<\/a>, and others, reform has been excruciatingly stagnant.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin resolving these issues, Dudley argues the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/us-digital-dollar-president-biden-crypto-executive-order\/\">Biden<\/a> administration should properly transfer authority, regulators should engage more knowledgeable counsel, and cryptocurrency industry experts should join designated committees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dudley additionally said that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u201can iterative approach, in which they place emphasis more on their objectives \u2013 say, combating money laundering and protecting consumers and investors \u2013 than on the means by which those objectives are achieved. Set a clear goal and let the participants take the lead in figuring out how best to get there in practice.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, Dudley cautioned against delaying the implementation of a coherent crypto regulatory infrastructure:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe longer officials wait, the greater the risks to consumers, markets and the economy \u2014 and the greater the chances that large losses due to cybertheft or a market crash in crypto assets will force an innovation-killing crackdown.
