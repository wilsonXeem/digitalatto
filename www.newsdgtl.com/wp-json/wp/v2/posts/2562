To facilitate the landmark dive, the company has acquired a plot of Land in the ever-popular metaverse, which will host an array of immersive railway system experiences for locomotive enthusiasts to enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>The railway-focused virtual space will be embodied in boundless, fun, and gamified experiences which have been built by an engaged collection of creators. Such activities will include driving trains, operating railway stations, visiting a <strong>MTR railway museum<\/strong>, and unlocking an ever expanding list of exciting adventures.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The project also abides by MTR\u2019s long term commitment to supporting the development of technology and innovation in Hong Kong (which is seen through its recent launch of the \u2018Go Smart Go Beyond\u2019 program), as the company are also exploring the opportunity to turn its Land into a STEM education facility. Here, MTR believe long-term benefits for the community can be created by seeking the expertise and services of local-based tech companies.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Dr Jacob Kam, CEO of MTR, had this to say on the exciting partnership: <i>\u201cWe are excited for the strategic partnership with The Sandbox to embark on our new journey in the metaverse and engage customers in a brand-new way. To pursue continuous enhancement, we challenge our status quo and keep abreast of new technology trends. This foray into the metaverse allows us to venture into the virtual space to build a fun place to interact with our community while at the same time also seize opportunities that would add to our real-world experience beyond bounds\u201d.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>With regards to the next stages of the project, a roadmap and initial <strong>virtual station<\/strong> in The Sandbox will be developed, with the latter being built with strong creative and social elements. Eventually, MTR\u2019s Land and all of its railway wonders will become open to the public, where players will be able to limitlessly create.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
