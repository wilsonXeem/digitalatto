However, not every crypto exchange supports the tokens you want to acquire. Therefore, you must do a lot of research on which exchanges to use for the tokens you want to own. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this article, we will cover the best crypto exchanges that you can use to buy <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/is-plu-a-good-investment\/\">Pluton ($PLU)<\/a>. Before we do that, let\u2019s briefly go through Pluton and what it offers to its users.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Pluton (PLU)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pluton ($PLU) is an <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum-based<\/a> token used in the Plutus network. In simple words, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/plutus.it\">Plutus<\/a> is a finance-based application that aims to integrate cryptocurrencies into our everyday lives. With crypto mass adoption imminent, projects such as Plutus make sure that people can get the best out of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pluton token has various features. Starting off with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-tokenomics\/\">tokenomics<\/a>, it has a total supply of 20 million PLU tokens, but only 9% of the total <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-circulating-supply-and-maximum-supply\/\">supply<\/a> is currently in circulation. Pluton offers its users a lot of financial services, including <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/pos-meaning-in-crypto-what-is-proof-of-stake\/\">staking<\/a>. Users can stake PLU tokens and earn passive income in return. The way this works is through the crypto cashback feature, where you can get up to 8% cashback on every payment you make with the Plutus Visa Debit Card, one of the main features of Plutus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only that, but you can also earn <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-pluton\/\">perks<\/a>, where each perk gives you a subscription to an entertainment service of your choice, such as Netflix, Booking, Spotify, Disney+, Apple One, Prime Video, Starbucks, etc. The more you stake, the more perks and purchase cashback you get.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, Pluton has been gaining a lot of attention due to its exciting features.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where to Buy Pluton (PLU)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a lot of cryptocurrency exchanges that support Pluton tokens. Nonetheless, based on our research, these are the best exchanges you can use to purchase $PLU:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plutus DEX<\/span><\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_25509\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-25509\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-25509\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Plutus Dex. \" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" data-wp-editing=\"1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/plutus.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-25509\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/plutus.png\" alt=\"Plutus Dex. \" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" data-wp-editing=\"1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-25509\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Plutus Dex. Source: Plutus.it<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first one on the list is the Plutus DEX. As the name suggests, Plutus DEX is Plutus\u2019 decentralized exchange, which aims to make the purchase of $PLU tokens as easy as possible. All you have to do is create a Plutus account, transfer fiat via a bank transfer to your account, connect the DEX with your MetaMask wallet, and buy $PLU tokens. You can also purchase ETH tokens using the Plutus DEX. While it may not offer a larger token list, it is quite safe, reliable, and simple to use. Moreover, through the Plutus DEX, you can access the other features that the Plutus app has to offer. Plutus can be used either through the web or through a mobile phone. However, you can use the Plutus DEX only if you\u2019re part of the EEA zone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, Plutus DEX is one of the best exchanges you can use to buy $PLU tokens.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KuCoin<\/span><\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_25510\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-25510\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/kucoin.svg.svg+xml\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-25510\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"KuCoin Logo. \" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/kucoin.svg.svg+xml\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-25510\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/kucoin.svg.svg+xml\" alt=\"KuCoin Logo. \" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"\/><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-25510\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">KuCoin Logo.

KuCoin is supported in more than 200 countries worldwide, but it is not licensed in the US yet. KuCoin offers more than 600 countries with different trading pairs available. In terms of fees, KuCoin has some of the lowest trading fees in the market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KuCoin was launched back in 2017, with headquarters in Seychelles. Currently, it has millions of users daily, and it has received tons of good reviews on the internet. Besides the web trading alternative, KuCoin is available to Android or iOs users as well, similar to Plutus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KuCoin is generally perceived as a safe exchange in terms of security, despite history showing that it was prone to be hacked in the past.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KuCoin provides tons of services when it comes to trading, earning interest through staking or lending, etc. Moreover, there are plenty of fiat payment methods with KuCoin, including a debit card, bank transfer, PayPal, etc. All in all, KuCoin is considered a very good choice for buying $PLU tokens.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coinbase<\/span><\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_25511\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-25511\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-25511\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Coinbase Logo. \" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/coinbase.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-25511\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/coinbase.png\" alt=\"Coinbase Logo. \" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-25511\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Coinbase Logo.

Coinbase is one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, and it is one of the very few major crypto exchanges that is licensed in the US. It is very user-friendly, and it is easy to use even for beginners. Coinbase offers more than 150 cryptocurrencies, including Pluton.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps one of the biggest downsides of Coinbase is that its fees are relatively higher when compared to the majority of other crypto exchanges. Nonetheless, millions of users actively trade on Coinbase, putting it in the top three of the most used crypto exchanges in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded in 2012, it is one of the oldest crypto exchanges to allow traders to buy or sell cryptocurrencies, starting off with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin (BTC)<\/a>. Coinbase now offers Coinbase Pro, which is for more advanced traders. This feature provides more sophisticated services, but it also provides lower fees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, Coinbase is one of the safest choices to buy PLU tokens if you\u2019re a US citizen.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huobi Global<\/span><\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_25512\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-25512\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-25512\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Huobi Global Logo. \" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/huobi-token-ht-logo.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-25512\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/huobi-token-ht-logo.png\" alt=\"Huobi Global Logo. \" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-25512\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Huobi Global Logo.

Based in Japan and originally launched in China in 2013, Huobi Global is one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the market. It offers more than 350 cryptocurrencies, with the number continuously increasing. It has relatively low trading fees, and it provides various trading tools to help you perfect your trades. Similar to the above-mentioned exchanges, Huobi Global also is available for desktop or for mobile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the disadvantages of Huobi Global is that it is a bit complex for beginners. So, amateur traders may find it difficult to navigate throughout the exchange and trade efficiently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of security, Huobi Global is quite safe. 98% of users\u2019 assets are held in a cold wallet, making sure that no hacker can steal the funds. Huobi Global is best at stopping DDOS attacks. Last but not least, it has around 20,000 worth of BTC as a reserve in case a major hack is to occur to the exchange. This gives some sort of relief and security to Huobi Global users.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, Huobi Global could be used as a safe choice when it comes to buying $PLU tokens.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitfinex<\/span><\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_25513\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-25513\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/bitfinex.svg.svg+xml\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-25513\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Bitfinex Logo. \" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/bitfinex.svg.svg+xml\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-25513\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/bitfinex.svg.svg+xml\" alt=\"Bitfinex Logo. \" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"\/><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-25513\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bitfinex Logo.

Launched in 2012, it is one of the most used crypto exchanges to date, with some of the highest volumes in the BTC\/USDT pair throughout the years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, Bitfinex is not available in the US, similar to some other exchanges. Nonetheless, it provides various trading types, including margin trading, OTC trading, etc. It also has relatively low fees, but its main audience is not beginners, as the dashboard may seem a little complex.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for security, Bitfinex is generally secure. However, it has suffered from attacks in the past. Nonetheless, 99.5% of all the funds are held in a cold <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-wallet-definition\/\">wallet<\/a> to make sure that they cannot be stolen by hackers.

While its trading volume may not be as high as the likes of Coinbase, it is still quite reliable when it comes to various types of trading. AscendEX also offers <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-decentralized-finance\/\">DeFi<\/a> services, where you can earn passive income through the exchange. Moreover, active traders receive random rewards from the exchange.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One disadvantage of AscendEX could be the fact that no fiat currencies are supported. Moreover, in terms of customer service, there is no call representative to help you out. Instead, you\u2019ll have to go the old-fashioned way by writing up your complaint.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AscendEX offers around 200 cryptocurrencies, and it is generally considered safe to use. Therefore, it could be an alternative for you to buy $PLU tokens.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UniSwap<\/span><\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_25515\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-25515\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-25515\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"UniSwap Logo. \" width=\"500\" height=\"499\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1026px-Uniswap_Logo.svg.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-25515\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1026px-Uniswap_Logo.svg.png\" alt=\"UniSwap Logo. \" width=\"500\" height=\"499\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-25515\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">UniSwap Logo.

UniSwap is undoubtedly one of the biggest decentralized exchanges in the crypto market. It technically supports every <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/erc-20-tokens-explained\/\">ERC-20<\/a> token, including $PLU. If the token you\u2019re searching for will not appear, you can import it by typing the contract address of the token. Since it is a DEX, you have to pay gas fees to purchase tokens. Moreover, you need to connect UniSwap with a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-web3\/\">Web 3.0<\/a> wallet that is based on Ethereum, such as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/metamask-review\/\">MetaMask<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the only downside of UniSwap is that you have to pay gas fees. If the network is congested, the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/gas-fees-meaning-what-are-gas-fees\/\">fees<\/a> can get quite high. Nonetheless, UniSwap is quite safe to use, and it has been one of the most used exchanges in the world for a while now.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeaways<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pluton is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency in the Plutus network.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of crypto exchanges have listed Pluton and can be used to purchase $PLU tokens.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the best exchanges to buy $PLU are the Plutus DEX, KuCoin, Coinbase, Huobi Global, Bitfinex, AscendEX, Uniswap, etc.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always do your own research before deciding which exchange to use to buy cryptocurrencies.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/where-to-buy-plu\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As cryptocurrencies become more important to the world day by day, it\u2019s important to know which crypto exchanges you need to use.
