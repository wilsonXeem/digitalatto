However, it is good to look at what this would mean in a space like the crypto industry that is used to fast-moving prices and quick-changing momentum. While the word \u201cboring\u201d may sound bad to investors who are used to these characteristics, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, Jurrien Timmer, explains why this could inherently be a good thing for the digital asset.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Draw In Institutional Investors<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">The need for institutional investors in bitcoin cannot be overstated. For the digital asset to get to some of the forecasted values, institutional investors moving into the market has become a necessity. But will these institutional investors want to move into a highly unpredictable asset such as bitcoin?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/halfway-to-the-halving-what-this-means-for-bitcoin\/\">Halfway To The Halving: What This Means For Bitcoin<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In his recent <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TimmerFidelity\/status\/1516868269885513729?s=20&amp;t=pNQKTMd1oVOObiU9H0eV0w\">Twitter thread<\/a>, Timmer explained that a \u201cboring\u201d bitcoin is important if institutional adoption is to be expected. Pointing to the S2F model created by the infamous Plan B, he explains that bitcoin has closely followed this model. However, there is a deviation that is starting to take place.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Director explained that instead of continuing to track the S2F model, BTC had instead started to follow the pink line which marked demand in the chart shared. This meant that as effective as Plan B\u2019s model has been in the past, it seems bitcoin is cutting out a new trend for itself and that is now entirely driven by the demand.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cSo, in a more efficient two-way market, Bitcoin should deviate around that pink line, up and to the right,\u201d Timmer explained.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-488573 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/bitcoin-demand-line-460x267.jpeg\" alt=\"Bitcoin demand line\" width=\"460\" height=\"267\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC sticking close to pink demand line | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TimmerFidelity\/status\/1516868269885513729?s=20&amp;t=ZZ1wfRJzCSi4FSICysAz_g\">Twitter<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Bitcoin Behaving Like A Traditional Asset<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Now, one of the great gospels of bitcoin is how different the digital asset is from traditional risk assets. Nevertheless, as more time has passed and adoption is growing, it is beginning to behave more like a traditional risk asset. As more understanding comes, the investors who are purchasing the asset move from simply a price standpoint and move towards more efficient accumulation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Timmer notes in his Twitter thread that institutional investors have likely come up with their own models which will help them know when a good time to buy bitcoin is. This could help them map out if they can get a 1.5x or 3x return from buying at a particular price.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/zECxdt7x\/\" alt=\"Bitcoin price chart from TradingView.com\" width=\"3278\" height=\"1758\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC trading in the mid-$42,000s | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/TradingView.com\">BTCUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cFor instance, If the demand model says that Bitcoin\u2019s intrinsic value is $50k today and $100k two years from now (my thesis), then at $30k Bitcoin is going to look a lot better than at $70k,\u201d he noted.
