Because there are 744 days until this happens, we are halfway between the third and fourth halving occurrences.<\/p>\n<p>Halving events are significant because they diminish the incentives given to miners for mining Bitcoin, which involves verifying new transactions and putting new currencies into circulation.<\/p>\n<h2>What will take place on May 4, 2024?<\/h2>\n<p>In the current era, which follows the third halving event on May 11, 2020, the miner receives a fee of 6.25 BTC for each Bitcoin block mined. Taking the daily average of 144 blocks indicates that around 900 BTC is now issued and awarded every day.<\/p>\n<p>The fourth halving event will \u2018halve\u2019 this reward and lower it to 3.125 BTC every block. If the daily average of blocks remains the same, roughly 450 BTC will be released in rewards every day.<\/p>\n<h2>What effect will the fourth halving event have?<\/h2>\n<p>After the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/19000000th-bitcoin-has-just-been-mined-only-2-million-left\/\">19 millionth Bitcoin block<\/a>, \u2018730002,\u2019 was mined on April 1, it became evident that just 2 million BTC remain out of the 21 million Bitcoin limit.
