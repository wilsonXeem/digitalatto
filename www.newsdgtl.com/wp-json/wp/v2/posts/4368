The current downtrend could be one of the worst since BTC\u2019s inception as the cryptocurrency recently recorded its first eight consecutive weeks in the red.<\/p>\n<p>The research firm claims BTC\u2019s price established important support at $29,000. This level coincides with 2021\u2019s lowest point during the May-July bearish price action.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, it should operate as strong support and as an important point to determine any future price action. If this level fails, Bitcoin could retest the $25,000 mark and the $20,000, which stands as the cryptocurrency\u2019s previous all-time high.<\/p>\n<p>Data from Material Indicators and Jarvis Labs provides clues about what is brewing in the market after the recent major move to the downside. During this time, the market usually enters a long consolidation period as liquidity pools below and above BTC\u2019s price are formed.<\/p>\n<p>Jarvis Labs claimed liquidity at $40,000 and $45,000 has been increasing in the past two weeks. Conversely, the liquidity around $28,000 and $25,000 experienced a surge.<\/p>\n<p>Large market participants are usually incentivized to move the price of a cryptocurrency towards those liquidity pools. This suggests a potential retest of BTC\u2019s price current lows and critical support zone to grab liquidity below before the cryptocurrency can move higher. The opposite could be in the cards.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_491326\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-491326\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-491326 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSD-Jarvis-Labs-460x339.jpg\" alt=\"Bitcoin BTC BTCUSD Jarvis Labs\" width=\"460\" height=\"339\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-491326\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Jarvis_Labs_LLC\/status\/1528970510444376066\/photo\/1\">Jarvis Labs via Twitter<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Who Is Buying The Bitcoin Dip?<\/h2>\n<p>Additional data provided by Material Indicators, for low timeframes, indicate important support for BTC\u2019s price at around $29,000.
