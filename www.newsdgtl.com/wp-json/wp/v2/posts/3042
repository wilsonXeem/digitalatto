This has been one of the most brutal downtrends for its investors, the majority of which are now drowning in losses. However, as they say, that one man\u2019s misfortune is another man\u2019s come up, whales have seen this as a perfect opportunity to buy up as much ADA as they can.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>They have now ramped up their buying and have accumulated about $200 million worth of ADA in the space of a month.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Whales Buy 194 Million ADA<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Over the past five weeks, Cardano whales have been busy accumulating the digital asset. These whales who hold between 1 million and 10 million ADA on their wallet balances have been the most active since the digital asset has been falling and trending around $1. It seems this has presented a buying opportunity to these whales who have now purchased 196 million ADA in this five-week period.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/billionaire-ricardo-salinas-fires-back-at-warren-buffetts-bitcoin-slander\/\">Billionaire Ricardo Salinas Fires Back At Warren Buffett\u2019s Bitcoin Slander<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Prior to this though, these same addresses have been on a dumping spree. It has caused their collective holdings to drop during this time and in the middle of March had hit one of the lowest points it has ever been. However, after prices had hit a new month low, the whales had resumed their accumulation trend which has increased their collective balances drastically.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udc33\ud83d\udcc8 <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Cardano?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Cardano<\/a> whale addresses holding 1M to 10M <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%24ADA&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$ADA<\/a> are accumulating their bags these past 5 weeks (196M more <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%24ADA&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$ADA<\/a>) after a 7-month stretch of dumping (-1.7M less <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%24ADA&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$ADA<\/a>).

This is not a new trend for Cardano whales though. In the first quarter of 2022 alone, it is reported that addresses that held between 1 and 10 million ADA on their balances had bought over 4 billion ADA. This had increased their collective balances to 12.19 before the dump trend that had started in the middle of March.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Cardano Hits Yearly Lows<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">The current price of Cardano is nothing to write home about but it seems that there is no clear end to this downtrend anytime soon. The digital asset has now managed to hit new yearly lows. ADA had last been at prices this low in February of 2021 and that was when the digital asset was at the beginning stages of its impressive 2021 bull rally.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/bCUkH4zR\/\" alt=\"Cardano (ADA) price chart from TradingView.com\" width=\"3278\" height=\"1758\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">ADA price hits one year low | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/TradingView.com\">ADAUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p class=\"p2\">Even though the network boasts one of the most loyal investors following in the space, its price does not reflect this loyalty, nor does it reflect all of the upgrades that are being made on the network. This coupled with the flatlining transaction volume paints a rather gloomy future for the digital asset.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/nft-market\/bored-apes-land-sale-broke-ethereum-extreme-success-or-roaring-failure\/\">Bored Ape\u2019s Land Sale Broke Ethereum.
