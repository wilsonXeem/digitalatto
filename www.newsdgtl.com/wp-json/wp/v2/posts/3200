Expected in June 2022, this update will upgrade the mainnet \u201cperformance properties\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cVasil\u201d is mainly aimed at making Cardano more efficient when processing decentralized applications (dApps) transactions. Thus, smart contract users on the network will benefit from a better experience.<\/p>\n<p>The network introduced its smart contract capabilities back in 2021 with a series of Hard Fork Combinator events (HFC) which ended with the \u201cAlonzo\u201d upgrade. Since that time, the Cardano ecosystem has seen an important expansion.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the growth, ADA\u2019s trading volume has been moving to the downside along with its price. As since below, this metric reached an all-time high in May 2021 and has seen trouble in getting back to previous highs.<\/p>\n<p>Conversely, ADA\u2019s transaction volume has been on the rise and recently hit a multi-year high. This suggests that while retail investors might not be as active on Cardano, whales are potentially buying the dip as the \u201cVasil\u201d upgrade approaches with the potential to increase the ecosystem\u2019s use cases and efficiency.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_489826\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-489826\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-489826 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Cardano-ADA-ADAUSDT-Chart-2-860x418.jpg\" alt=\"Cardano ADA ADAUSDT Chart 2\" width=\"860\" height=\"418\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-489826\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Token Terminal<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Cardano Facilitates Entry Into Its Ecosystem<\/h2>\n<p>Cardano developer IOG recently revealed the launch of Essential Cardano.
