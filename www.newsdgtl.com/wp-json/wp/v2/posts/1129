Stargate is a bridge solutions running on top of it.<\/p>\n<p>By integrating with SushiSwap, the decentralized exchange (DEC) could unify the liquidity spread across its 16 different versions. In that way, users would access cheaper cross-chain transactions, more security, new products and investment strategies.<\/p>\n<p>If the integration is approved, for example, liquidity providers on this DEX could expand their rewards. In step of receiving a portion of the transaction fees for 1 liquidity pool running on Ethereum, they could collect rewards from all the pools across the SushiSwap ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>The voting process that will accept or denied this potential integration has begun. Data <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/sushigov.eth\/proposal\/QmcDgHnhXNWMQQU6zp6eYM3nhywN317JtQLtNWtwBVXHsx\">provided<\/a> by the DEX\u2019s governance; this voting will end on April 4, 2022.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, a majority of SUSHI holders have voted yes on the proposal with 6.4 million of the token at the time of the snapshot. This represents 99.99% of the votes so far which suggest overwhelming support for this proposal.<\/p>\n<p>The proposal was presented by Tangle and OxMaki and promises to provide a better user experience for cross chain swaps, maximize trading volumes on Sushi pools, and more benefits to the DEX\u2019s treasury. The proponents wrote:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We propose to have Sushi integrate Stargate to facilitate Omnichain native asset swaps and transfers between networks. This will help unlock the power of Sushi by allowing users to move freely between assets and networks.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>SushiSwap Signals More Gains<\/h2>\n<p>The DEX and its native token seem to be reacting to this announcement. A pseudonym analyst caught the move to SUSHI\u2019s current levels based on an On-balance volume (OBV), a metric used to measure momentum, downtrend break for the daily chart.<\/p>\n<p>As seen below, the analyst believes SUSHI could reach as much as $6 if the token is able to sustain its current momentum. With the apparent imminent approval of the Stargate integration proposal, a continuation of the upward trends seems likely.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%24SUSHI&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$SUSHI<\/a> \u2013 Nice looking setup with a downtrend break on OBV with confluence with a double bullish supertrend. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/GqyKDeaUO4\">pic.twitter.com\/GqyKDeaUO4<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 IncomeSharks (@IncomeSharks) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IncomeSharks\/status\/1509296325178798083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 30, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Related Reading |<\/strong> <strong><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/defi\/sushiswap-escaped-350m-defi-hack\/\">SushiSwap Narrowly Escaped A $350 Million DeFi Hack, Here\u2019s How<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Additional data provided by Material Indicators (MI) suggest investor with bids orders between $100,000 are dominating the current price action.
