Meanwhile, the price per BTC is grinding along a parabolic support line that over the last decade has proven to put in <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-bear-market-comparison-time-for-bull-season\/\">bottom after bottom<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-bear-market-comparison-time-for-bull-season\/\">Bitcoin Bear Market Comparison Says It Is Almost Time For Bull Season<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The cryptocurrency became a household name in late 2017 due to its parabolic rally that eventually broke down and took the price per cryptocurrency back to $3,200. The retest of that level on Black Thursday only added to the base-building in the chart below.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-488399 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/BTCUSD_2022-04-19_10-05-52-860x391.png\" alt=\"BTCUSD_2022-04-19_10-05-52\" width=\"860\" height=\"391\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Attention, base 4.

Between base 3 and base 4, the parabolic asset \u2013 BTC in this case \u2013 <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-bear-market-comparison-time-for-bull-season\/\">doubles in value in a very short time<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>From late 2020 to April 2021, Bitcoin price grew over six to twelve times in value during what would have been the run up from base 3 to base 4. According to this diagram, base 4 is also quite steep, allowing price to climb dramatically higher. The only problem is, this final base, if valid, suggests the end is near for this decade-long bull trend line.<\/p>\n<p>With a parabolic trend line violated, the top cryptocurrency by market cap could plunge as much as 80% from whatever highs are set. Past bear markets have resulted in <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/peter-brandt-bitcoin-price-bottom\/\">more than 84% declines<\/a> from top to bottom. Parabolic rallies also tend to break down faster than it took to climb \u2013 similar to a rollercoaster\u2019s anxiety-inducing ascent, followed by a speedy plunge and the ride is over until you decide to get on once again.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cBulls take the stairs, bears take the elevator\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-488402 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screen-Shot-2022-04-19-at-10.27.05-AM-860x398.png\" alt=\"bitcoin \" width=\"860\" height=\"398\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">On-chain signals support a bottom at this level | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/studio.glassnode.com\/trading_view\">Glassnode<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2>On-Chain Signals Support Bitcoin Bottom At Current Levels<\/h2>\n<p>On-chain signals, like entity-adjusted dormancy flow exhibit similar signs of accumulation going on as other moments Bitcoin put in a significant bottom.
