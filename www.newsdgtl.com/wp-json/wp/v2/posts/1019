After purchasing a unique robot NFT (there are 10101 Drunk Robots NFTs in total), players will have to fight for survival as they attempt to seize control of Los Machines.<\/p>\n<p>Engage in brutal PVP battles, venture out on expeditions to find $METAL and booze, join a gang of fellow drunks, and customize the robot with upgraded weapons, gear, and collectibles. Drunk Robots also offers many free-to-play activities, such as mini-games that also grant valuable rewards.<\/p>\n<h3>What is $METAL used for?<\/h3>\n<p>Through their battles and adventures in Drunk Robots, players will earn various rewards, such as equipment and upgrades for their fighters, in the form of NFTs.
