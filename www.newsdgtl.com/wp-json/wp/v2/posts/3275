As per the record, LFG is a nonprofit based in Singapore, which is linked to the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/terra-luna-price-prediction-2022\/\">Terra Luna<\/a> ecosystem.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Diving Into the LFG Acquisition<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">LFG was able to acquire 37,863 BTC through over-the-counter (OTC) swaps. These swaps were done with the broker Genesis Trading and another buying from a leading <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">crypto<\/a> company called Three Arrows Capital. In order to complete this acquisition, the deal was to swap $1 billion OTC with Genesis in exchange for $1 billion in UST. The deal also included a $500 million BTC purchase from Three Arrows firm. In accordance, this contract was finalized on Thursday.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Currently, the holdings of LFG reach $3.5 billion worth of BTC. As a result of this, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">according <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to CNBC, LFG is listed among the top-10 holders on a global scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">1\/ The LFG has acquired an additional 37,863 Bitcoins totaling ~$1.5 billion in OTC swaps with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GenesisTrading?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GenesisTrading<\/a> and 3AC. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/Ezzfwl7VFn\">https:\/\/t.co\/Ezzfwl7VFn<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 LFG | Luna Foundation Guard (@LFG_org) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LFG_org\/status\/1522234947070689280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 5, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Luna Foundation Guard Closer to Its Goal<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The goal of LFG is to collect roughly $10 billion in Bitcoin. The main reason for this purchase is to be able to back algorithmic stablecoin U.S. Terra, otherwise known as UST. Previously, in March, LFG bought $139 million worth of BTC. This purchase was made months after the firm showed its interest in collecting high amounts of digital assets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Correspondingly, the CEO of Terraform Labs, Do Kwon, emphasized his goal. Kwon noted that he wants to establish a BTC reserve. The idea is to compete with that of Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto is the digital asset\u2019s pseudonymous creator.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Just getting started <img src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1f609.png\" alt=\"\ud83d\ude09\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em;max-height: 1em\" \/> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/dJrkf6YfrR\">pic.twitter.com\/dJrkf6YfrR<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 TerraLunaaaa <img src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1f316.png\" alt=\"\ud83c\udf16\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em;max-height: 1em\" \/> (@TerraLunaaaa) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TerraLunaaaa\/status\/1509120568783740934?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 30, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the most popular algorithmic stablecoin is UST.

Meanwhile, the other two stablecoins that reach higher market value are Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Besides LFG making high BTC purchases, another company takes part in this activity too. A publicly-traded firm called <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.microstrategy.com\/en\">MicroStrategy<\/a> is following the same path as LFG. It seems like the fluctuation of BTC\u2019s price is not affecting its purchases. Henceforth, in April MicroStrategy accumulated 4,197 BTC in its reserve funds. Given these purchases, the company has a total holding of 129,218 BTC.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/luna-adds-38000-btc-to-reserve-fund\/\">Luna Foundation Guard adds 38,000 BTC to Its Reserve Fund<\/a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\">Crypto Academy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/luna-adds-38000-btc-to-reserve-fund\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As part of the reserve strategy, Luna Foundation Guard has acquired 38,000 BTC.
