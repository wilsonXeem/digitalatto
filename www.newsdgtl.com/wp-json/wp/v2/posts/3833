Everyone seeks exposure to NFT assets, representing a market worth roughly $17 billion. The introduction of white-label solutions and an interconnecting marketplace by Niftables may lead to much higher valuations.<\/p>\n<h3>The NFT Industry Growth Continues<\/h3>\n<p>The past two years have been rather wild for the cryptocurrency industry. More specifically, the introduction of non-fungible tokens has brought major investors, celebrities, and mainstream users over to this industry. While NFTs are primarily speculative \u2013 like cryptocurrencies \u2013 several projects have established a long-term presence. Together, all projects combine for an estimated market cap of over $17 billion in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>That market cap is a big step up from $82.5 million in 2020. It is uncanny how far the NFT vertical has come in such a short time. Moreover, brands and creators continue to express an interest in this industry. Unfortunately, they are held back by a lack of convenient and automated solutions taking care of everything surrounding the creation of a new collection.<\/p>\n<p>Niftables may hold the solution to this pressing matter. Any creator or brand can venture into the NFT segment through its upcoming white-label solution. The framework powering that shift possible is the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.niftables.com\/\">Niftables<\/a> metamarket, enabling full automation of NFT utilities and seamless frontend and backend integration into an NFT network. Creators launch collections directly into a market, providing utility through a wider ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, the metamarket approach enables support for VR and AR-compatible 3D galleries. Combined with fiat and crypto payment gateways and integrated custody solutions, the technology stack makes it straightforward for mainstream users to become part of the non-fungible token world. Additionally, creators can distribute NFTs through subscription services, drops, auctions, etc., giving them full control.<\/p>\n<h3>The Niftables Marketplace Vision<\/h3>\n<p>Niftables also aims to launch a cross-chain gas-free NFT marketplace to help enthusiasts buy, trade, sell, swap, or redeem NTs and rewards from creators\u2019 white-label platforms. The marketplace will act as a hub to browse verified white-label platforms, stores, profiles, and collections. Furthermore, Niftables\u2019 integration with Rarible and OpenSea will help facilitate secondary market sales.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Niftables Co-Founder Jordan Aitali adds:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em>A one-stop-shop doesn\u2019t mean one-size-fits-all. That\u2019s why Niftables is built to let creators and brands fully customize their white-label NFT platforms from the get-go<\/em>.<em> We ensure that each creator\u2019s NFT platform is in tandem with their branding and overall vision.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Niftables $NFT asset will be a crucial aspect of this ecosystem. It is a payment method throughout the ecosystem, including the white-label platforms established by creators and brands. Additionally, $NFT holders will benefit from customized user profiles and discounted purchase rates across all external white-label platforms.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/company\/niftables-wants-to-take-nfts-into-the-mainstream-with-a-new-marketplace-and-white-label-solution-for-creators\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The mainstream appeal of non-fungible tokens has never been more outspoken than it is today.
