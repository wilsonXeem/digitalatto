The round was led by industry powerhouse and notorious Web3 investors <strong>Animoca Brands,<\/strong> with participation also coming from DCG, Sfermion, B3V, Spartan Group, MHC Digital Finance, WhaleShark, and 17 other key players.<\/p>\n<p>With the help from the new injection of funds, the platform\u2019s community of 6,000+ Metakey NFT holders can look forward an array of exciting new developments. This will include the expansion of the Metakademy (a Web3 educational platform), multiple game integrations of the Metakey and Metakrew, large-scale The Sandbox integrations, and collaborations and corresponding reward initiatives. Holders will also get access to more metaverse platforms, rewards, real-life events, and exclusive phygital (digital and physical) merchandise.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The funds will also be used to expand the project\u2019s team in order to develop its widely interoperable gaming and social ecosystem \u2018New Ganymede\u2019 from open demo to full release and service. The developments will also relate to the ecosystem\u2019s coinciding season pass rewards system, which, in the future, will integrate with The Metakey, Metakrew, and a myriad of other<strong> metaverse services<\/strong> and platforms such as The Sandbox, Decentraland and more.<\/p>\n<p>Co-founded by NFT builder DCLBlogger and Mohsi K. back in May 2021, Metakey has already expanded into a team of nearly 30 artists, developers, community managers and marketers, which have each been part of dozens of high-profile collaborations and integrations with other <strong>Web3 innovators<\/strong>. Overall, the funding round has boosted the 11 month old company\u2019s valuation to a whopping $50 million, where within such valuation, sit investments from 24 high-profile backers.<\/p>\n<p>In speaking on Animoca\u2019s lead of the funding round, Yat Siu, the company\u2019s executive chairman and co-founder, had this to say: \u201c<i>The Metakey supports a multi-platform approach to your digital assets and is led by a team of OG crypto and NFT enthusiasts (including DCLBlogger) with deep expertise and expert understanding of the space and the opportunity. Cross-platform interoperability is the key to growing the open metaverse and we are excited to be backing The Metakey!\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Follow Metakey &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/themetakey\">Twitter<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
