The agreement, which was facilitated by NFT lending platform <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NFTfi\">NFTfi<\/a> on March 19th, reportedly included the option for \u2018refinancing deal\u2019 to take place a month after it was initiated. However Rajkumar<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>is claiming that chefpierre did not abide by such extension, and instead foreclosed on the loan which ultimately released the NFT from the platform\u2019s escrow to chefpierre\u2019s wallet.<\/p>\n<p>In wake of such events, Rajkumar is alleging \u2018unjust enrichment\u2019 has taken place, which in doing so, has led to the decision to cease the asset\u2019s ability to be traded. \u00a0<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although the case\u2019s conclusion remains to be seen, and whilst lawyers have been alluding to the legal complexities which can arise within loan agreements which involve\u00a0pseudonymous parties (something NFT-finance is prone to), <strong>a spokesperson from OpenSea has spoken<\/strong> on the platform\u2019s polices with regards to legally-questionable assets:<\/p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhile we don\u2019t offer details about enforcement actions on individual collections, I can share that our platform policies and Terms of Service explicitly prohibit the use of OpenSea to buy, sell or transfer stolen items, fraudulently obtained items, items taken without authorisation and\/or any other illegally obtained items or launder money\u201d.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
