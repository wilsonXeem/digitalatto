Adding support for these chains aims to expand Coinweb\u2019s consolidated solution for decentralized application (dApp) developers.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u201cThe Ethereum family of chains is made up of entirely different structures compared to Bitcoin-derived chains. To date, proof-of-concept has been delivered by managing cross-chain transactions across Bitcoin-derived chains, all of which have similar structures. Coinweb has now proven its compatibility with the two largest families of chains, whose structures are completely independent of one another. This achievement paves the way for the platform to carry on its aggressive drive to connect a significant number of chains to deliver real-world usage and adoption.\u201d<\/strong><br \/><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/coinweb.io\/\"><strong>\u2013 Coinweb CEO, Toby Gilbert<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Current projects built on the Coinweb platform will commence using the multi-chain broadcasting system, writing transactions to both Bitcoin-derived chains and the Ethereum family of chains, which can be viewed on the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/the.explorer.coinweb.io\/\">Coinweb explorer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike cross-chain bridges, other interoperability solutions, and current connection schemes, Coinweb\u2019s unique coupling of blockchains at the protocol level makes it possible to exchange information and create dApps between any combo of blockchains plus maintain the security properties of the underlying layers.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, Coinweb\u2019s reactive smart contracts maintain gas balance while continuously monitoring each underlying chain for events that will trigger their execution, enabling larger volumes of computations and self-sustenance across chains.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about the specifics of Coinweb, check out the project\u2019s <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/coinweb.io\/files\/Coinweb-Whitepaper.pdf\">whitepaper<\/a>.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"mashsb-container mashsb-main mashsb-stretched\">\n                <\/aside>\n<p>            <!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.8.1-->\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/p><\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptoninjas.net\/2022\/03\/24\/layer-2-cross-blockchain-platform-coinweb-adds-support-for-ethereum\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Coinweb, a layer-2 blockchain interoperability protocol, announced today the addition of the Ethereum underlying chain to its expandable blockchain infrastructure.
