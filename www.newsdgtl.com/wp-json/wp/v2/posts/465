Binance Labs is the venture capital arm of the largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Binance, for Web3 to scale and grow its use cases, privacy is extremely important. And Manta is \u201cbringing a unique and valuable approach to tackling this issue,\u201d Nicole Zhang, Investment Director at Binance Labs said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring on Binance Labs as a strategic investor, and look forward to working with them in expanding Manta Network\u2019s privacy utility to other networks and decentralized applications,\u201d stated Kenny Li, co-founder of Manta Network.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manta Network\u2019s mission is to bring privacy as a utility to crypto space. The project has launched its Dolphin Testnet, which has seen over 10K in unique private transactions. The testnet features will be deployed on its Calamari Network in MariPay.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At launch, MariPay will privatize various parachain assets on Polkadot\u2019s early, experimental version Kusama including Kusama\u2019s native asset KSM and Calamari\u2019s native asset, KMA. Manta is currently working with several parachains to make the privatization of their projects\u2019 assets interoperable as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the short term, as a product, Manta Network will enable high-performance private DeFi transactions, and in the long term, Manta aims to be the infrastructure for privacy-preserving blockchain applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p><script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n!function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s){if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?\nn.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;\nn.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;\nt.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window,\ndocument,'script','https:\/\/connect.facebook.net\/en_US\/fbevents.js');\n<\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.the-blockchain.com\/2022\/02\/16\/manta-networks-push-to-leverage-zkp-to-transact-with-privacy-attracts-investment-from-binance\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Crimes in the cryptocurrency space reached an all-time high of $14 billion in 2021.
