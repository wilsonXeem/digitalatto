As such, narratives tend to drive the price action. When the cryptocurrency is bullish, it moves in a powerful parabolic impulse up. When things are bearish, the rollercoaster ride turns scary and many get ejected along the way.<\/p>\n<p>Markets might seem like an unpredictable rollercoaster at times, but on several time scales, they can be quite predictable. In the 1930s,\u00a0Ralph Nelson Elliott developed what he referred to as Wave Principle. According to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ralph_Nelson_Elliott\">Wikipedia<\/a>, \u201cElliott stated that, while stock market prices may appear random and unpredictable, they actually follow predictable, natural laws, and can be measured and forecast using Fibonacci numbers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/now-or-never-bitcoin-builds-base-at-decade-long-parabolic-pattern\/\">Now Or Never: Bitcoin Builds Base At Decade-Long Parabolic Curve<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Today, the study is more commonly referred to at <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/school.stockcharts.com\/doku.php?id=market_analysis:identifying_elliott_wave_patterns\">Elliott Wave Theory<\/a>. Each \u201cwave\u201d has a specific type of characteristic and guidelines. Waves alternate between bullish and bearish phases. Odd numbered phases are impulse waves that move in the primary trend direction, while even numbered waves are corrective phases that move against the primary trend.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to waves alternating between positive and negative growth, they also alternate in their degree of severity. And according to the Guideline of Alternation, one correction is typically sharp, while the other is flat or sideways.

Sharp corrections tend to be over with a lot faster than a flat-style correction, which painfully grinds sideways. The market itself still has a sort of post-traumatic bear market syndrome from the severity of the sharp style correction, that it is expects the market to behave in the same manner yet again.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/time-vs-price-bitcoin-correction\/\">Time Vs Price: Why This Bitcoin Correction Was The Most Painful Yet<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>However, according to the Guideline of Alternation, the probability of two of the same type of corrections is extremely low. In rare situations, two sideways corrections occur, but never two sharp corrections. This suggests that whenever Bitcoin price finally does turn around, the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/time-vs-price-bitcoin-correction\/\">corrective wave four<\/a> should be complete and the grand finale wave five will begin.<\/p>\n<p>What happens after wave five is complete?
