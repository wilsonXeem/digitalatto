Perhaps a lower focus on that is given to countries in Africa. Savanna is one of the very few projects that aim to change the living standards in many places of Africa. As a blockchain-based cryptocurrency, Savanna is building an ecosystem that allows everyone to help in the cause of making Africa a better place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/savanna.global\/\">Savanna\u2019s<\/a> powerful mission, this article aims to look at the fundamentals of Savanna as well as its potential in the world and in the crypto market. Let\u2019s begin with brief information on the nature of the project.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Savanna (SVN)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savanna is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency built on the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-smart-chain-bsc\/\">Binance Smart Chain (BSC)<\/a>. The main goal of the project is to help change many parts of Africa within 10 years. As you may know, Africa has been prone to many unfortunate events in the last few decades, including wars, lack of edible food or water, immense poverty, etc. Because of that, the Savanna team built this ecosystem that would allow people to trade cryptocurrencies as well as donate to the Savanna charity at the same time. This system is achieved by the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-tokenomics\/\">tokenomics<\/a> of Savanna, which we will elaborate on shortly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the long-term goal of Savanna to help people in Africa, Savanna has other intermediate goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of them is building a big community. With a bigger community, the long-term goal becomes much more attainable. Savanna has already experienced an increase in growth over the last few months. Hence, its community is increasing by the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another operating goal is to compensate <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/hodlers-meaning\/\">holders<\/a> of the SVN token, which is the native token of the Savanna ecosystem. Through a transaction tax, every SVN HODLer receives passive rewards as an incentive to keep holding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last but not least, Savanna uses a deflationary model that burns a portion of the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-circulating-supply-and-maximum-supply\/\">supply<\/a> with each transaction. This means that the price of SVN may keep increasing as it gets scarcer and the demand increases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is worth mentioning that despite being relatively new to the market, Savanna has partnered with the likes of Aguatech and Saudabel to help <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> making the project more potent in the crypto space.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Team<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The founders of Savanna are Amaan and Mark. Both of them are students at <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Luanda International School in Africa. Using their knowledge and experience in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, they managed to create a promising project such as Savanna. Also, the fact that both of them reside in Africa gives the community a sense of belief in what the team is doing for helping Africa become a better place.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokenomics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of tokenomics, Savanna has a total supply of 1 quadrillion SVN tokens. Because of the relatively large supply, the price of SVN is still relatively low.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With each SVN transaction, there is a 10% fee. Out of this 10%,<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5% goes to the Holders as a reward.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3% goes for charity.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.8% goes to the liquidity pool.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.2% goes for development purposes.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roadmap<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to the roadmap, Savanna has five main stages.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first stage is about the first charity donation from the taxed transactions. This first phase shows to the community that the Savanna token is really trying to help out people in Africa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second stage is about growing the Savanna community. They aim to do this through multiple interactions with the community by making giveaways, directly communicating with them, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third stage is about making aggressive marketing, which could be key for Savanna gaining global exposure. Also, the team is working on making NFTs based on Savanna that would help in increasing the market cap of the coin and the volume of charities at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last but not least, the last stage of the roadmap entails more strategic partnerships and being listed in major crypto exchanges. This stage is primarily determined by how SVN performs in the coming months. Judging by the promising features that Savanna has, then we may see SVN get listed in many exchanges.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savanna (SVN) Price Prediction<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on this brief review on Savanna (SVN) as well as taking into account the many price factors of SVN, we could see its price skyrocket in the coming years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking into account other market factors such as crypto mass adoption as well as the BTC halving of 2024, we could see SVN go 1000x from its current point. This increase would see the price of SVN reach as high as $0.000001.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, as the community of Savanna grows, so does the trading volume. As the trading volume grows, more tokens are burned due to the deflationary properties that Savanna has. Lastly, as more tokens get burned, the price of SVN may increase at even larger rates. Hence, SVN could even go beyond that point in the coming years of this decade. Keep in mind that the token may get listed in other exchanges as well, making it much more accessible to users and further increasing the buying pressure for SVN.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24094\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24094\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-24094 size-full\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Savanna Price Forecast\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-1-10.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-24094 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-1-10.png\" alt=\"Savanna Price Forecast\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24094\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Savanna (SVN) Price Prediction 2022-2026.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion: Is Savanna (SVN) A Good Investment?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, is SVN a good investment? While it\u2019s still early to determine how SVN could perform in the coming years, its fundamentals certainly suggest that this coin has the potential to soar high in the coming years. Not only that its mission is great, but it also is profitable to holders. Because of this, SVN could perhaps be a profitable investment in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeaways<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savanna is a BSC-based cryptocurrency that aims to help people in Africa with its charity system.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SVN has a total supply of 1 quadrillion, but its supply is deflationary as it has a burning mechanism.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a 10% tax for every SVN transaction.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, Savanna could be a good investment in the long run.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\">\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/shibaswifecommunity\"><img src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" style=\"width:auto ;height:auto;\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/1649069820_257_ShibasWifeBannerGif3-1.gif\"\/><noscript><img src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/1649069820_257_ShibasWifeBannerGif3-1.gif\" style=\"width:auto ;height:auto;\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/is-savanna-a-good-investment-heres-what-you-should-know-about-svn\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The cryptocurrency market is known for having a diversity of projects that aim to help the world become a better place.
