Router Protocol supports any crypto token swap on the network.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Support for arbitrary tokens \u2013 <\/strong>most cross-chain platforms are permissioned where only listed assets can be traded. Router Protocol allows arbitrary token swaps by aggregating liquidity across all the major DEXes on any given chain.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mesh Network \u2013 <\/strong>instead of building 1:1 bridges that require dedicated links between chains, Router is building a many-to-many mesh network that allows seamless data flow between various chains. Any chain can be added with a few lines of configuration.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Settlement guarantee \u2013 <\/strong>Router Protocol ensures no blocking for user funds and guarantees settlements of all transactions by providing users equivalent amounts of USDC or RUSDC (which can be redeemed 1:1 for USDC).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u201cAs two of the most popular L2 solutions on Ethereum, this integration marks significant progress in our mission to connect all L1 and L2 chains.

In addition to a bug bounty program with the security platform Immunefi, the project has completed security audits from Certik and Halborn and is currently undergoing a third audit from Hacken.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Moreover, the Router team has several security features built into its network including:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A modular smart contract architecture \u2013<\/strong> denotes different contracts for functions like liquidity, fees, voting, etc. to separate out functions against monolith structures which is typically followed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>On-chain validation \u2013 <\/strong>the validation is achieved on-chain, which is more secure than protocols using off-chain consensus.<\/li>\n<li><strong>An Isolated execution module \u2013 <\/strong>transactions are executed on a stateless execution pallet that can avoid direct interaction with the bridge reserves. Keeping the reserves isolated from the execution environment prevents malicious entities from accessing the reserve funds.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A dedicated proxy architecture \u2013 <\/strong>Router Protocol retains the option to update the contract in case of any contract vulnerability\/bug.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In other developments, the Router Protocol team recently announced a governance proposal inviting the community to decide which two EVM chains to integrate next. The governance event is an important step in the direction of transitioning Router Protocol into a community-governed project.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"mashsb-container mashsb-main mashsb-stretched\">\n                <\/aside>\n<p>            <!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.8.1-->\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n<div class=\"jeg_post_source\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Source:<\/span><br \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.routerprotocol.com\/\">routerprotocol.com<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptoninjas.net\/2022\/04\/12\/router-protocol-adds-optimism-and-arbitrum-to-its-cross-chain-messaging-platform\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Router Protocol, an infrastructure layer enabling communication between blockchains, today announced it has added Optimism and Arbitrum to its platform.
