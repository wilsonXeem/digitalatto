He points out they\u2019ve maintained stability through multiple black swan shifters and highly volatile markets, never refusing redemptions with them either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ardoino stated;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tether continues to process redemptions normally amid some expected market panic following yesterday\u2019s market. In spite of that, Tether has not and will not refuse redemptions to any of its customers, which has always been its practice.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Differences Between USDT And Algorithmic Stablecoins<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When the market is uncertain, it can be hard to make decisions. Ardoino offered perspective about the technical differences between USDT and algorithmic stablecoins, which may have helped reduce some of the market\u2019s fear, uncertainty, and doubt.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unlike these algorithmic stablecoins, Tether holds a strong, conservative and liquid portfolio that consists of cash &amp; cash equivalents, such as short-term treasury bills, money market funds and commercial paper holdings from A-2 and above rated issuers.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ardoino believes that stablecoins will continue to be a vital cog in the cryptocurrency space, despite the Terra (LUNA)\/UST situation causing some people to lose confidence in their ability to redeem token swaps for their $1.00 peg.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He said that he does not think people have lost trust in centralized stablecoins. On the contrary, he believes that people will always use them because they offer a way for traders to interact with the larger crypto ecosystem.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_490358\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-490358\" style=\"width: 589px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-490358\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/12-may-460x270.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin price chart\" width=\"589\" height=\"346\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-490358\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bitcoin bounced back from $25,000 support currently trading above $27,000 | Source: BTC\/USD price chart from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/?symbol=BITSTAMP%3ABTCUSD\">Tradingview.com<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Stablecoin UST and LUNA collapse have sent shockwaves through the markets. However, customers could exchange LUNA for 1 UST or vice versa as the relationship was pretty straightforward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When the price of UST fell below its $1.00 peg, a lot of people started trading it for LUNA. This was called arbitrage trading. People were burning UST to get $1.00 worth of LUNA, which they would then sell for a profit. But because so many people were doing this, the value of LUNA kept dropping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/ape\/terra-not-alone-in-crimson\/\">LUNA Not Alone In Crimson: APE, AVAX, SOL, SHIB All Lose 20% In Crypto Crash<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Crypto Fear and Greed index measures how people feel about cryptocurrencies.
