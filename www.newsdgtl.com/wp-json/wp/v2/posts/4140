There were real consequences. When individuals like Mr. Hayes operate platforms without anti-money-laundering programs or know-your-customer programs, they become a magnet for people to launder money.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Considering criminals are highly incentivized to circumvent the AML measures and KYC procedures, we can categorically say that John Koeltl\u2019s assumptions are skewed. However, that doesn\u2019t justify not complying with the law. According to Samuel Raymond, not sending Hayes to prison \u201cwould send a message to him that the cost of doing business is merely a fine, and he could continue to violate the law for huge amounts and pay any fine.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What About The Other BitMEX Co-Founders?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The article is about Hayes, so, it doesn\u2019t go into detail about the others. It summarizes their situation as follows:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cHayes and co-founder Benjamin Delo pleaded guilty in February, and Samuel Reed in March, each agreeing to forfeit $10 million. Delo is scheduled to be sentenced next month and Reed in July.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To close it all off, James Benjamin, Hayes\u2019 lawyer, states the obvious. \u201cDid BitMEX do a perfect and seamless job on its path from startup to a mature fintech company? No, it did not. There were some bumps in the road.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-491033 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/LUNAUSD_2022-05-21_05-27-49-460x256.png\" alt=\"LUNAUSD price chart - TradingView\" width=\"460\" height=\"256\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">LUNA price chart on FTX | Source: LUNA\/USD on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/LUNAUSD\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Arthur Hayes On The Terra Luna Collapse<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As many crypto-experts knew, Terra was a disaster waiting to happen.

Terra and others like it cannot force anyone to use UST at any price. They must convince the market with their fancy designs that the governance tokens backing the protocol will have a non-zero value that rises more quickly over time than the amount of fiat-pegged tokens issued.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Obviously, the model failed.
