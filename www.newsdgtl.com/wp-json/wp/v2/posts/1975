This way, they raise its value. In the meantime, they plan to sell off their remaining coins at the \u201cinflated\u201d price. Thus, they gain much profit using these tactics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Respectively, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BenPhillipsUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Ben Phillips<\/a>, who used to be an influencer for SafeMoon, has been charged with running a $12 million crypto scam. They are accusing him of using his power to spread the word about SafeMoon while also selling millions of tokens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Regarding this issue, Stephen Findeisen, also known as \u201cCoffeezilla,\u201d has made accusations against Phillips on his YouTube channel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><noscript><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I Caught This Youtuber Scamming for $12,000,000\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/xgMyFb0JnsE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/noscript><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SafeMoon Is Bringing In Millions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Like many other influencers, Ben Phillips, who is well-known for his YouTube prank films, is very engaged in the worlds of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a> and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-nft-non-fungible-tokens\/\">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)<\/a>. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Additionally, SafeMoon is a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-smart-chain-bsc\/\">Binance Smart Chain (BSC)<\/a> cryptocurrency project that Phillips constantly mentions. However, this could be the root of all of the problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">According to Coffeezilla\u2019s investigation, Phillips was continually selling his SafeMoon for millions of dollars. This happened after pumping it through his social media networks and seeing the price rise.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Scam of Phillips<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">On April 12 of last year, Phillips shared his <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-wallet-definition\/\">wallet<\/a> information with fans in a tweet. In addition, he requested that they pay for his Starbucks. Correspondingly, this gave the space to the internet detective, Coffeezilla, to investigate a tip he had received. This was part of a bigger investigation into the fake investment game token SafeMoon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Furthermore, the YouTuber also shared screenshots of all tweets. In these tweets, Phillips made similar comments, grouped chronologically, and also particular information on his dumps. He even had critical <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bscscan.com\/\">BscScan<\/a> URLs that traced his activities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As per CoffeeZilla\u2019s estimates, Phillips bought SafeMoon on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/pancakeswap-review-2022\/\">PancakeSwap<\/a> for $4 million in March. On the other hand, he sold it for $16 million in December, leaving him with a tidy $12 million profit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SafeMoon \u2013 Not a Safe Place<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SafeMoon came out in March 2021, and it was a huge success right away. However, in December 2021, the team launched a Version 2 contract at a different contract address. This resulted in the Version 1 contract being no longer valid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Phillips, on the other hand, has deleted most of his posts and his Twitter account seems to be a new one. Nonetheless, in his previous tweets, he has used a lot of harsh language. One from July last year said he wished a SafeMoon whale would \u201cbe hit by a bus.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/scam-by-former-safemoon-marketing-chief\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Bitcoin market is experiencing tremendous growth, and digital assets are becoming more popular.
