Some graphs from the document are in <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/05\/11\/grayscale-tells-sec-that-turning-biggest-bitcoin-fund-into-etf-will-unlock-8-billion-for-investors.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the CNBC report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, although in low resolution. In general, the GBTC\u2019s transformation into a spot bitcoin ETF \u201cwould open them up to ordinary investors in a familiar wrapper that trades like a stock.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The main argument from Grayscale is that a bitcoin futures ETF already exists, and the \u201cSEC is discriminating against issuers\u201d by not letting any company create a spot bitcoin ETF. \u201cGrayscale contended that a spot bitcoin ETF is \u201cno riskier\u201d than futures-based ETFs, because the two markets are both affected by the underlying price of bitcoin and track each other closely,\u201d said CNBC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Back<\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/04\/17\/grayscale-ceo-matter-of-when-not-if-the-sec-allows-bitcoin-spot-etf.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in April Grayscale\u2019s CEO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Michael Sonnenshein, felt more litigious when he said:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIf the SEC can\u2019t look at two like issues, the futures ETF and the spot ETF, through the same lens, then it is, in fact, potentially grounds for an Administrative Procedure Act violation.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The SEC visit and the threat of legal action have not been Grayscale\u2019s only weapon.

There are institutions that can\u2019t invest in bitcoin as an asset, but could definitely put their money in an ETF. Some believe that the sudden influx of funds that these people would bring would send bitcoin\u2019s price to the moon. Unlike a future ETF which only holds future contracts, a spot ETF would have to buy the bitcoin it\u2019ll represent. So, the money would definitely enter the bitcoin ecosystem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/sec-ripple-agree-to-extend-legal-battle\/\">SEC, Ripple Agree To Extend Legal Battle Until 2023; XRP Bears The Brunt Of Case<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On the other hand, Bitcoiners don\u2019t see what they deem as \u201cpaper bitcoin\u201d with good eyes. The financial instrument would represent bitcoin, but the ETF isn\u2019t the asset per se. This puts investors at risk and brings forth certain vulnerabilities to the bitcoin network. The \u201cpaper bitcoin\u201d could be considered inflation and something akin to fractional reserve banking is technically possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In any case, neither group has the finger on the trigger.
