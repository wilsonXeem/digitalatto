This could suppress the price from continuing its bullish momentum.<\/p>\n<p>On the other side of the trade, there is major support for BTC\u2019s price at $39,000.

BTC\u2019s current EMA stands at around $42,000.<\/p>\n<p>In that sense, Bitcoin needs to break above that price point to continue upwards into further resistance. This potentially will be located at around $45,000, and $48,000.

This metric stands at its November 2020 low, according to data from Arcane Research. At that time, the decrease in volatility and BTC\u2019s long period of consolidation preceded a major rally into its current all-time high levels.<\/p>\n<h2>Why A Weakening U.S. Dollar Could Push Bitcoin Upwards<\/h2>\n<p>BTC bulls seem to be displaying more strength. The liquidity sitting lower at $30,000 appears to have moved up which leads to faster BTC price bounces. This contributes to the bullish thesis for the cryptocurrency as it could be preparing for an imminent break of short to mid-term resistance.<\/p>\n<p>On the latter, analyst David Ellis <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DavidPBitcoin\/status\/1516730146728079361?s=20&amp;t=s-hYhBifXysvLZVmojiEVA\">said<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(\u2026) I\u2019ve been staring at the charts for long stretches of time the past week-plus.
