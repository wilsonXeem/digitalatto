The interest to own and flip NFTs by everyone keeps soaring day by day; hence it is vital to have some basic metric knowledge to measure the potential value of an NFT.<\/span><\/p>\n<h5><b>Floor Price<\/b><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The floor price, also known as \u201centry price\u201d, simply means the price of the least expensive NFT in a collection of NFTs. The floor price is the smallest amount of money one can purchase or pay to join or own an NFT project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Purchasing an NFT at the floor price is regarded as a strong entry strategy since it provides an accessible entry point for new members of an NFT initiative. The <strong>floor price is an excellent statistic<\/strong> for gauging how well-received an NFT project is by the community. As demand grows, the floor price will rise as well. This means that if you purchase the least expensive NFT in a collection hoping, that it will become more popular, you can resell the NFT at a higher floor price.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help visualize the meaning of floor price, consider the Doodles NFT. According to OpenSea, Doodles NFTs come in a joyful range of colours, traits, and sizes with a collection of 10,000. The floor price of the Doodles NFT is at the time of writing 15.98 ETH. This means that the most affordable Doodle NFT out of the 10k Doodles collection costs 15.48 ETH.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #1d1d1d;\"><b>Market Cap<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another metric aside from the floor price to analyze an NFT is its estimated market cap. A great tool for measuring the estimated market cap of an NFT is <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/rarity.tools\/\">rarity.tools<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market cap is computed by multiplying its seven-day average price by its total supply. NFT marketplaces are often illiquid, which means you\u2019d need to find a buyer that is willing to purchase your NFT when you are ready to flip it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This means that a high<strong> estimated market cap<\/strong> suggests that there are more interested parties ready to pay a greater price to purchase an NFT. In a nutshell, NFTs with a high estimated market cap is a good sign.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get the estimated market cap, log on to rarity.tools, scroll down the page and type in your favourite NFT project to have a look at the market cap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37674 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652004294_464_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"860\" height=\"617\"  \/><\/p>\n<h5><b>Diamond Hand Value<\/b><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An excellent tool for checking the diamond hand value of an NFT is <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nansen.ai\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nansen\u2019s analytical tool<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This third metric used to quantify an NFT collection is the <strong>percentage of owners<\/strong> who have not sold their initial NFT collection and are ready to hold their assets for a very long time, no matter the volatility or losses. Knowing the diamond hand value gives a pointer to knowing long-term believers in a project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nansen.ai\/research\/utilizing-nansen-investing-in-nfts\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nansen\u2019s website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, diamond hands balance refers to the total balance of NFTs belonging to addresses that have not sold any NFTs from a particular collection.\u00a0 In short, diamond hands balance refers to the number of holders who plan to hold an NFT with long-term foresight (opposite of paper hands which is the regular case for collections which is evidently used for short-term flipping).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h5><b>Unique Holders<\/b><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fourth parameter used to determine an NFT\u2019s worth is the number of unique holders. A useful tool for checking the number of unique holders of an NFT is <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/browse\/dashboards\">dune.xyz<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This metric is used to <strong>determine the size<\/strong> and how big the community surrounding a project is. The larger the community, the more the support, which helps sell the project to a larger pool of potential purchasers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37675 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"870\" height=\"626\"  \/><\/p>\n<h4><b>Volume Traded<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fifth metric you can utilize is the NFT collection\u2019s volume traded. You can use OpenSea to check the trading volume of NFT collections.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This metric illustrates <strong>the collection\u2019s overall demand<\/strong>. The volume exchanged provides insight into the popularity of an NFT collection; the higher the volume, the better the indication that people must be willing to buy and sell. The volume traded is also an indicator to assess whether an NFT project is in demand at the moment or not, and the higher the volume also shows how liquid the market is.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To check the volume traded, check out the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/rankings\">OpenSea Rankings<\/a> page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37676 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"954\" height=\"618\"  \/><\/p>\n<h5><b>Rarity Score<\/b><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last and the most relevant metric on this list is the rarity score, used to quantify the collection\u2019s potential value. You can use <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/rarity.tools\/\">rarity.tools<\/a> for this.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NFTs with a higher rarity score are<strong> often more valuable<\/strong> than those with a lower rarity score. With a rarity score, NFT collectors can assess and evaluate the value of a single NFT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each trait of an individual NFT is assigned a rarity score, and the rarity scores for all of the NFT\u2019s traits are put together to generate an overall rating. The following is an illustration:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37677 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"784\" height=\"717\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Make sure to always do your own research, and check the factors listed above, before buying an NFT!<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
