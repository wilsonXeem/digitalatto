Over the last 24 hours, the altcoin brought home 4.8% gain. Although, there has been a considerable daily gain, AVAX is trading underneath its long-standing price floor.<\/p>\n<p>It is difficult for investors to look at just the daily gain as a good enough reason to buy the coin at the moment.

This forced many investors to liquidate the asset and leave. Since, AVAX broke below its long term support area, this could act as an important red flag for the investors.<\/p>\n<p>The next solid area of support for AVAX was at $20.

The altcoin has been laterally trading at that price mark for nearly a week now. It revisited this price mark last year, however, back then the coin was on an uptrend.<\/p>\n<p>Immediate resistance for the coin stood at $40 as established previously. A fall below the current price level could send AVAX near the $20 support mark. Failing to settle near the $20 mark could bring AVAX anywhere between the $12 and $9 support level.<\/p>\n<h2>Technical Analysis<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_491097\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-491097\" style=\"width: 1816px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-491097 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/AVAXUSD_2022-05-23_01-08-48.png\" alt=\"Avalanche\" width=\"1816\" height=\"705\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-491097\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Avalanche depicts low buying strength on the one day chart | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/AVAXUSD\/?exchange=BINANCE\"><strong>Source: AVAXUSD on TradingView<\/strong><\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The altcoin continues to depict weakness on its chart. The technical outlook seems bearish because buyers are nowhere to be seen in the market. As the coin revisited the August, last year\u2019s price level, AVAX remained under the grasps of the sellers in the market.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Relative Strength Index, the indicator was bordering the oversold mark. Until and unless, RSI manages to move above the half-line, it is too early to call this price action a reversal.<\/p>\n<p>Going by the Directional Movement Index that reads the price direction, bears are in control. The -DI line was above the +DI mark signifying bearishness. The Average Directional Index line (red) was near the 50-mark, this reading meant that price action was strong with less signs of a reversal.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/avalanche\/avalanche-crumbles-more-than-16\/\"><em><strong>Suggested Reading | Avalanche Crumbles More Than 16% As Crypto Landslide Continues<\/strong><\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_491098\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-491098\" style=\"width: 1816px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-491098 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/AVAXUSD_2022-05-23_01-09-36.png\" alt=\"Avalanche\" width=\"1816\" height=\"706\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-491098\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Avalanche might be flashing buy signal on the one day chart |<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/AVAXUSD\/?exchange=BINANCE\"><strong> Source: AVAXUSD on TradingView<\/strong><\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>On the one day chart, AVAX\u2019s technical pointed towards a possible change in price direction at the time of writing.
