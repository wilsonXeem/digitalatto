Meanwhile, on Wednesday it reached up to 1.5 billion. As of today, the number rose to 25.3 billion. These statistics show a high increase from the previous day and it is still continuing to rise.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, it seems like there is a factor affecting the two tokens. In a thorough analysis, we can see that a behavioral cycle is a key influencer in UST losing its peg. Also, this behavioral cycle is pushing forward a massive amount of selling. In order to help the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-stablecoins\/\">stablecoin<\/a> keep its peg to the US dollar, traders are exchanging UST for Luna. This situation is resulting in chaos because of the high level of Luna minting, while its price is decreasing.<\/p>\n<h3>Luna&#8217;s Price Drop<\/h3>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/token-meaning-what-is-a-cryptocurrency-token\/\">token<\/a> prices are falling as Luna&#8217;s supply continues to grow at an alarming rate. Luna&#8217;s current market value is just $0.005 compared to $80 six days ago. This makes it a drastic decrease.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, a lot of Luna holders are affected by this price downturn. Additionally, YouTuber <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KSI?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">KSI<\/a> noted that his $3 million worth of Luna is now worth only $100.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">What a week.
