Early adopters have either created DAOs themselves or been pulled into projects through their personal connections, and those experiences have led them to test the waters with other projects. Those new to web3 will need education, navigation, and tools to manage their experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.daohq.co\/\">DAOHQ<\/a> is a DAO marketplace that aims to help with the discovery, maintenance, and investment of DAOs all over the world. I\u2019ve been following DAOHQ for a while, and I had the opportunity to connect with their Co-founder, Emmet Halm for a quick conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Tell us a little background on why you started DAOHQ.<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We see DAOs as decentralized joint-stock companies on-chain. Historically, the joint-stock company was one of the most powerful inventions of the last two hundred years. We\u2019re hopeful that DAOs will enable new kinds of international collaboration and economic opportunity. Despite this, <strong>DAOs are in their early days.<\/strong> To start, it\u2019s difficult to find and research DAOs and even more difficult to invest and vote. For the average person, there are still too many steps to get involved, which is why we\u2019re building DAOHQ.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>What are you working on today?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are focused on building the product and the team. On a granular level, lots of outreach on LinkedIn &amp; Discord to connect with full-stack &amp; smart contract candidates. We\u2019re building a tight-knit, mission-driven, relentless team that values speed, self-improvement, and<strong> integrity<\/strong>. On the product side, I\u2019ll jump into our Figma files to provide design feedback and take user interview calls to see how people interact with our current product.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>What are some exciting things on the roadmap?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without giving too much away, we\u2019re excited to be the first to provide a seamless mobile-first experience for <strong>DAO discovery<\/strong>, investing and voting. Most people spend more time on their phones than on their laptops, GenZ and Millennials live on their smartphones, and smartphones have a wider global reach. We are bringing the DAO experience directly to users where they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>How will DAOHQ help people discover and contribute to DAOs?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, you can explore over 1,000 DAOs on DAOHQ. We have a DAO-personality quiz to start your personal matching engine and give you a few DAOs that fit your goals and interests. We\u2019ve also seen users take advantage of the sort by category feature. If you\u2019re interested in <strong>investing in a DAO<\/strong>, you can trade directly from DAOHQ. If you\u2019re looking to become a core contributor, you can follow the Discord links to connect with the core team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Like most teams, DAOs generally follow the 80\/20 rule: 20% of contributors drive 80% of results. This means eight out of 10 DAO members are investors and voters rather than developers. We\u2019re building to make investing, voting, and joining communities easy. We\u2019re also working with select DAOs to help them match talent to core contributor roles.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are curious about DAOs and want to learn more, <strong>DAOHQ<\/strong> provides a consolidated view of over 1,000 DAOs ranking them by token price and community growth. DAOHQ also organizes tips and market updates categorized by beginner, intermediate and advanced experience levels. If you already have a DAO, you can submit your DAO for inclusion in the marketplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Follow DAOHQ &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dao_hq\">Twitter<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
