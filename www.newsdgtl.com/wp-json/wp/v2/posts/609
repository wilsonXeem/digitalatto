Contrary to the centralized incumbents who are bound to operational bottlenecks when expanding, Pocket Network is relieved of the burden of running their own nodes.<\/p>\n<p>In this sense, Pocket operates similarly to the most prominent marketplaces like Uber and Airbnb. Situating itself as a coordination-providing intermediary network also allows the network to remain chain agnostic, function as an L0, and rapidly scale the services into new chains.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u201cWe live by the ethos of decentralization, our globally distributed decentralized infrastructure eliminates single points of failure and increases network security.\u201d<\/strong><br \/><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pokt.network\/\"><strong>\u2013 Michael O\u2019Rourke, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Pocket Network<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Projects in DeFi, GameFi, etc. with difficulty sourcing secure infrastructure due to regional differences in regulation can choose Pocket Network. Pocket\u2019s protocol automatically load balances and distributes work to the global network of community-owned nodes, ensuring availability to any country, at any time. Integrated availability reclaims vital resources, that can be used to cut costs or be reallocated elsewhere.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"mashsb-container mashsb-main mashsb-stretched\">\n                <\/aside>\n<p>            <!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.8.1-->\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/p><\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptoninjas.net\/2022\/03\/11\/blockchain-middleware-protocol-pocket-network-expands-global-availability\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pocket Network, an infrastructure middleware protocol that facilitates decentralized cloud computing and abundant bandwidth on full nodes to other applications in Web3 across 37 blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, Fuse, and Harmony, announced today its decentralized node infrastructure has expanded globally across 6 continents and into 30+ countries.
