The initiative will be initiated at the inaugural Miami Grand Prix, which takes place across the weekend of May 7th-8th.<\/p>\n<p>The first element of the \u2018Mercedes-AMG Petronas x NFTs\u2019 concept is the distribution of free-to-claim \u2018Ticket Stubs\u2019 NFTs, which are digital and artistic interpretations of <strong>Mercedes F1 race tickets<\/strong>. There will be 2,500 NFT Ticket Stubs dedicated to each of the season\u2019s races, which will each be randomly distributed to fans who register their interest in the initiative.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The second NFT offering, which is essentially an extension of the first, is the distribution of 1,000 limited edition (but still free) Ticket Stubs at five races across the season\u2019s calendar. In announcing the concept, Mercedes F1 also confirmed that the upcoming <strong>Miami Grand Prix<\/strong> is one of the selected races, with the four other remaining races being kept under wraps for now.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The third type of NFT on offer deviates from the collection\u2019s free-of-charge ethos, as each of the exclusive 10 assets can only be picked up via auction on the FTX US NFT marketplace. With the Miami Grand Prix being one of them, this NFT instalment sees multi-disciplinary artist Mad Dog Jones curate two exclusive NFT artworks to go alongside five selected races.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In the Miami edition, the NFT artwork will feature the cars driven by the team\u2019s drivers Lewis Hamilton and George Russell, as well as physical, Mad Dog Jones-designed rear wing plates which will be used on the car race day. The NFTs, which Mercedes F1 have described as \u2018the first ever chance to own a piece of both digital and physical motorsport history,\u2019 will go up for auction on <strong>May 6th<\/strong> on the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/ftx.us\/nfts\">FTX NFT marketplace<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, and for those thinking that the team had forgotten about the season opening races in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Imola (perhaps because of their disappointing performances), Ticket Stub NFTs for these events will also be rolled out at the Miami Grand Prix, meaning in total, the weekend will be distributing 13,500 free NFTs, and two auctioned NFTs.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Sign up to FTX to become eligible &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/ftx.us\/\">Here<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
