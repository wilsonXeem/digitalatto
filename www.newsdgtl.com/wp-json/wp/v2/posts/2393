The expensive nature of NFTs presents challenges for fans, collectors, and potential community members who often lack the capital to participate in the NFT marketplace. Amber Group\u2019s relationships put it in a unique position to bring greater convenience into the NFT ecosystem, enabling the fractionalizing of NFTs. Through fractionalization, NFTs can be owned by multiple individuals, creating openness for a broader segment of crypto enthusiasts who would otherwise not be able to participate in the trading of NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>PleasrDAO turned <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PleasrDAO\/status\/1508158737768493064\">one year old<\/a> in March 2022 making it one of the longest-running DAOs and was formed when its members purchased pplpleasr\u2019s Uniswap V3 \u201cx*y=k\u201d animation for 310 ETH. The NFT depicts a pink unicorn making its way towards an Ethereum logo-cradling oasis. Foreshadowing at its finest.<\/p>\n<p>Since then, PleasrDAO has collected other big-ticket items \u2014 all linked to what it describes as \u201cculturally significant\u201d ideas and causes. This includes the original Doge meme turned NFT from the owner of Kabuso in Japan and the one-of-a-kind unreleased Wu-Tang Clan album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin purchased from the US government.<\/p>\n<p>PleasrDAO last raised an undisclosed sum from a16z and top crypto investors in December.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cAmber Group moved quickly and thoughtful providing us with doge-class service,\u201d <\/em>explains Tridog, head of The Doge NFT project.<em>\u201d We are excited to allow easier access to our tokenized community and first class ticket to dogentertainment.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cNFTs are integral to the broader digital asset ecosystem, and greater accessibility to NFTs will undoubtedly accelerate the overall awareness and growth of the entire industry,\u201d<\/em> said Tiantian Kullander, Co-founder of Amber Group.<em> \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with PleasrDAO in bringing this convenience to fractionalized NFTs.
