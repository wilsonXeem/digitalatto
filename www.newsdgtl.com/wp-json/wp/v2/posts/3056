Terra\u2019s native cryptocurrency LUNA closely follows with a 15.5%.<\/p>\n<p>These losses seem small when compared to other cryptocurrencies in the top 100 by market cap. Tokens that were higher in the ranking, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Avalanche (AVAX), now record as much as 20% losses in one week alone.<\/p>\n<p>According to a recent report from Arcane Research, smaller cryptocurrencies have been underperforming in the current market conditions. Investors seem to be fleeting to \u201csafety\u201d as the appetite for risk decreases pending a potential 50 basis point increase from the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED).<\/p>\n<p>While Bitcoin and larger cryptocurrencies have been showing a correlation with a 16% loss for April, Arcane Research\u2019s small-cap index and mid-cap index are trending lower. The former record a 30% loss while the latter records a 29% loss over the same period.<\/p>\n<p>Conversely, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has been moving opposite to small coins. This metric stands at 42% with a high probability of extending as macro-conditions continue to prove unfavorable. Arcane Research noted:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stablecoins also see growing dominance. UST has entered the top 10, becoming the first algorithmic stablecoin to achieve this. We now have three stablecoins among the top 10, and 4 among the top 11, illustrating the current flight to safety tendencies in the market.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_489612\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-489612\" style=\"width: 837px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-489612 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSD.jpg\" alt=\"Bitcoin BTC BTCUSD\" width=\"837\" height=\"509\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-489612\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Arcane Research<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>What To Expect From Bitcoin In The Short Term?<\/h2>\n<p>A separate report from FTX Access claims the market is pricing 50 bps hikes for the upcoming four FED meetings.
