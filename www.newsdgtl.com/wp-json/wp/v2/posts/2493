This week I present to you the wonderful Nick Drivas aka <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/neeko_artist\">Neeko<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Neeko\u2019s art aims to bring to the world puzzle pieces of his consciousness, the pieces of his true self, the pieces of all of us together as one. There are many dark places on this planet, but Neeko aims to be the light that guides and outshines these parts of the world.<\/p>\n<p>So let\u2019s dive into the art world of this visionary artist and find out more about his NFT journey.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How did you find out about the NFT space, and what attracted you to create your own NFTs?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I found out about NFTs through seeing some of the visionary artists I follow minting their work on SuperRare and Foundation. Clubhouse is where I found out about the space, I met a lot of amazing friends and creators and just had fun in rooms chatting with other people trying to figure out what this all was.<\/p>\n<p>What attracted me to create\/mint my own NFTs was the lack of audience and engagement on other social platforms. I finally found a place where I could share my work and not feel like I was just throwing it down an abyss.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How often do you create?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Everyday.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What is your creative process?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>My inspiration comes from the closed eye visuals seen during psychedelic experiences. Before starting any piece I like to meditate and clear my mind of any unnecessary baggage. My process consists of working in VR to sculpt the 3d model I will work with. I then take that 3d model into Blender and work on lighting, texturing, and animating. A bit of touching up in Photoshop\/After Effects.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37020 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/neeko3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"842\" height=\"806\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Are there any CryptoArtists you would love to collaborate with?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There are a TON, but to name a few, Glass Crane, LaneDigitalArt, Ayjay Art, and Ben Ridgway.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What do you think the future of CryptoArt will look like?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It is really hard to say honestly, we are apart of something brand spankin\u2019 new that no one is truly experienced in. I think what the future looks like is artists working together and creating communities not only based on their own art but as a collective of sorts.<\/p>\n<p>I know there are a lot of creators (including myself) that want to see their art friends win, but everyone is on their own journey. I think being on a journey together would help bring more eyes to the path these creators are following. There are so many gems out there that just don\u2019t get seen by the right people.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37019 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/neeko2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"853\" height=\"863\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What are you currently working on?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I just finished the artwork for a 10k collection that should be coming out in the coming months. But currently transferring some of my works from 3D to 2D. Simultaneously creating a webstore to sell merch with my work on it! Coming soon!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Where can collectors find your work?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I mint mainly on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/foundation.app\/@neeko_artist\">Foundation<\/a> and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/funki-friends\">OpenSea<\/a> but collectors can find my work and more about me <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/linktr.ee\/neekoart\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37017 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/neeko-1024x567.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"567\"  \/><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
