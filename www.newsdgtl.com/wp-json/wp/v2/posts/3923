Ripple Case \u2013 Receiving Positive Response<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sunday was a good day for Ripple as it went up by 5.07% which happened following Saturday\u2019s gain of 0.92%\u00a0 However, XRP ended the week on a sour note as it spiraled down by 21% to $O0.4475. XRP was down despite the positive turnout on Ripple\u2019s court submission on Friday following the SEC v. Ripple case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ripple has evidently filed a reply last week to SEC in relation to the William Hinman\u2019s speech made in 2018.\u00a0 Hinman, ex-SEC Director of the Division of Corporation Finance, is the main or pivotal figure in this legal battle between SEC and Ripple.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In Hinman\u2019s speech in 2018, he mentioned that Bitcoin and Ethereum are not securities. SEC is now trying to cover up emails and other documents such as Hinman\u2019s declaration or speech and other private or internal discussions that can be used as evidence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/Bpbok7tG\/\" width=\"1824\" height=\"870\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">XRP total market cap at $20.76 billion on the daily chart | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2><b>Ripple On Reversal?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A lot of indicators show that Ripple is oversold which means it can push towards an upward trend in the short term. Now, to validate that reversal, the price must overshoot towards a higher high and onto a higher low. The price should be pulled to a price of $0.65 to create a bullish momentum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, the structure can be dubbed bullish if Ripple manages to go to a higher high right above the resistance zone. However, its last ascending wave seems weak which means a retest is a possibility. More so, the resistance zone also goes through an <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ichimoku<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> cloud, making it entirely difficult for the bulls to maneuver through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Suggested Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/crypto\/crypto-analyst-predicts-1-altcoin-will-fall-down-hard-is-it-cardano\/\">Crypto Analyst Predicts 1 Altcoin Will Fall Down Hard \u2013 Is It Cardano?<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As Ripple\u2019s price got to the green zone thrice in the past year, it can now be regarded as weaker support.
