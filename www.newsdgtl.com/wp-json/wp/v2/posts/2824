The series is called the \u20182022 NFL Draft,\u2019 and features 52 different collectible NFTs which are each dedicated to the league\u2019s 32 teams.<\/p>\n<p>The NFTs, which sport a traditional French suit playing cards aesthetic, are already on sale, and can be <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nfl.live-nfts.com\/explore\">purchased<\/a> for $52 a piece. As those who\u2019ve already engaged with the NFL\u2019s virtual commemorative ticket NFT concept will know, a purchase will not be the only way of getting your hands on one of the NFTs, as they will also be distributed to a portion of lucky fans who <strong>attend select NFL games<\/strong>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In addition, part of the collection will also be given to members of this year\u2019s Inner Circle Club, which includes fans who\u2019ve been selected to represent each team on Draft night.<\/p>\n<p>According to the NFL\u2019s Director of Club Business Development Sam Rubinroit, its Polygon-based marketplace is still very much in the \u2018test and learn phase,\u2019 despite being launched in November 2021. That being said, and with aid from the hectic NFL schedule, the marketplace has been able to produce various projects throughout its relatively primitive six month lifespan.<\/p>\n<p>So far that includes the distribution of virtual commemorative ticket NFTs to <strong>NFL game attendees<\/strong>, collections based on the NFL play-offs and its champions, and an inaugural \u2018Regular Season Clubs\u2019 NFTs collection, which previously saw its assets being traded for thousands of dollars.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
