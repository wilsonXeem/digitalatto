Good Or Bad?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The start of the Bitcoin Miami Conference 2022 could provide the bulls with some support. The event is usually filled with positive announcements with a direct impact on BTC\u2019s price.<\/p>\n<p>However, the macro-factors preventing Bitcoin and other risk-on assets to reached new highs seem to be re-gaining relevance. The U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) began its tapering process within expectations but could turn more aggressive as inflation persist.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $43,900 with a 5% loss in the last 24-hours and 7-days.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_487664\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-487664\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-487664 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSD-1-860x386.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin BTC BTCUSD\" width=\"860\" height=\"386\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-487664\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">BTC holding on support on the 4-hour chart.

Data from Material Indicators records little support for BTC\u2019s price until around $42,000. Therefore, any short-term selling pressure could take BTC to revisit the low of its current levels.<\/p>\n<p>In the long term, Senior Commodity Strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence Mike McGlone said the benchmark crypto flashed a buying signal in its BI trend signal. Used to measure momentum in the market, the analyst said this is the first time since late 2021 that BTC turns bullish.<\/p>\n<p>As seen below, the signal has proceeded with major rallies over the past 7 years. McGlone added the following on the potential for BTC to reclaim higher levels:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the past seven years there have been 30 signals, with a relatively high 66% of them notionally profitable. Though macro factors remain unfavorable, and the broader pattern is still a large range of $30,000-$70,000, the current rally may have legs similar to the signal of August 2021, which preceded a rally of 65%.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_487667\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-487667\" style=\"width: 856px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-487667 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSD-1.jpg\" alt=\"Bitcoin BTC BTCUSD\" width=\"856\" height=\"519\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-487667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Bloomberg Intelligence<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>A Strong Dollar Could Play Against Bitcoin<\/h2>\n<p>The rally in the U.S. dollar seems to be fueling the current downside price action.
