After a sold-out IDO, Animoca Brands-backed Drunk Robots has partnered up with Infinity Force and 3 major guilds \u2013 has just rehauled its game economy after a sold-out IDO, increasing the rewards and making it even easier to enter the game. <\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Drink, fight, earn<strong><br \/><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>After \u2018play to earn\u2019 and \u2018move to earn\u2019, has the time come for \u2018drink and fight to earn\u2019? At least that\u2019s what the robots of Los Machines do all day long: consume vast quantities of beer, then thrash each other around.<\/p>\n<p>Despite this violent premise, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/liquidifty.info\/3M3TMuJ\">Drunk Robots<\/a> is outrageously fun \u2013 and very well designed at that. In fact, the robots look so good that the original collection of 10,101 characters was immediately sold out on Liquidifty and Binance NFT. You can currently buy robots in closed containers on the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/app.liquidifty.io\/\">Liquidifty marketplace<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While you do need a robot to fight in the Arena or scavenge $METAL, there are several mini-games that you can play 100% free \u2013 such as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/knockout-game.drunk-robots.com\/\">Knockout<\/a>, where you have to shoot at other robots before they shoot you.<\/p>\n<p>The project counts 23,000 Discord members, over 64k Twitter followers, and 39k Telegram channel subscribers \u2013 for a total of 126 thousand users in the community. Few P2E games can boast such a large following just weeks after the IDO.<\/p>\n<h3>Drunk Robots introduces a 5,000,000 $METAL prize pool for the Arena leaderboard<\/h3>\n<p>The Play2Earn element of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/liquidifty.info\/3M3TMuJ\">Drunk Robots<\/a> is also well thought-out. Players earn prizes for participating in battles \u2013 and then they get even more if they manage to rise to the top of the leaderboard at the end of the season. This creates a strong incentive to compete in the Arena every day.<\/p>\n<p>On May 4, the team announced big changes to the game economy ahead of the second season, which starts on May 6.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, the seasonal prize pool for PvP (player versus player) battles is <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/drunk-robots.medium.com\/5-000-000-metal-reward-in-pvp-arena-9c956b38d86b\">increased to 5 million $METAL tokens<\/a>. A single robot can earn a player around 3,840 $METAL a month.<\/p>\n<p>The creators have also updated the prices of containers with robots, equipment, and energy booze (a special energy drink that robots need after a brawl).<\/p>\n<p>Starting from the second half of the season, players will need to take part in at least 5 battles every 24 hours to keep farming $METAL \u2013 or face a drop in the farming speed.<\/p>\n<h3>4 major gaming projects already collaborate with Drunk Robots<\/h3>\n<p>Drunk Robots has also been expanding its roster of partnerships, adding three major gaming guild projects in a few weeks:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/yggsea.io\/\">Yield Guild Games SEA<\/a> (YGG SEA, $SEA): the Southeast Asia branch of YGG, uniting 30,000 scholars across 18 countries;<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/drunk-robots.medium.com\/drunk-robots-partnership-with-avocado-guild-8371f874aa9a\">Avocado DAO<\/a> ($AVG): a community of 11,000 scholars playing games like Axie Infinity and Revv Racing;<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/skillguilds.io\/\">Skill Guilds<\/a>: providers of an advanced guild manager dashboard and a guild-building SDK.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The latest partner to be announced is <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/infinityforce.com\/\">Infinity Force<\/a> ($YNFF), a platform that connects players, guilds, and games.<\/p>\n<p>These collaborations follow a strategic partnership with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/meritcircle.io\/%20https:\/drunk-robots.medium.com\/strategic-partnership-with-merit-circle-f3fae1c33278?source=user_profile---------12----------------------------\">Merit Circle<\/a>, perhaps the most influential DAO in the blockchain gaming industry.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-490226 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Picture182.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"642\" height=\"444\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Apart from these gaming partners, Drunk Robots boasts an exceptionally strong list of backers among venture firms, including Animoca Brands, Shima Capital, Moonrock Capital, and DEX Ventures, as well as Gate.io, ZB.com, and Oracles Investment Group.<\/p>\n<h4>$METAL IDO sold out on 3 launchpads<\/h4>\n<p>Amid all this partnership-building, Drunk Robots also held a highly successful IDO for its $METAL token. On April 7, three launchpads \u2013 <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/app.liquidifty.io\/launchpad\">Liquidifty<\/a>, TrustPad, and GameFi \u2013 together sold 25,000,000 $METAL at $0.01 each, raising $250,000. Once $METAL was listed on PancakeSwap and Gate.io, the price rose over 300% above the IDO price to reach $0.43.<\/p>\n<p>$METAL has many uses in the Drunk Robots economy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>reward payouts and scavenging (farming);<\/li>\n<li>leveling up robots and their equipment;<\/li>\n<li>drunk races (yes, it\u2019s a completely legit activity for robots);<\/li>\n<li>re-rolling opponents in PvP battles, and much more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-490227 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Picture183.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"642\" height=\"589\"  \/><\/p>\n<p><em>Drunk Robots\u2019 roadmap for the next few months includes more detailed visualizations in the PvP arena; gangs and clans; farming virtual land, and more.
