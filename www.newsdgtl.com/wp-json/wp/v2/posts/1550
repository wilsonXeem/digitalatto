The Galaxy Digital CEO who was recently at the Bitcoin 2022 conference held in Miami had spoken in favor of the cryptocurrency once more, highlighting the future potential of the digital asset. Novogratz gave his prediction speaking at the conference but this is not the first time that the billionaire would be making such a prediction.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Pushing Bitcoin To $500,000<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Novogratz who put bitcoin at $500,000 in the next half-decade had shared thoughts behind this prediction. One of those had been the economy and the growing inflation rates that have been plaguing it. The Federal Reserve had been working non-stop with increasing interest rates and stuff but the billionaire notes that once the Fed begins to take a pause from all of this, then the digital asset would resume its upward movement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-trading-volume-remain-at-low-levels\/\">Bitcoin Trading Volume Continues To Remain At Low Levels<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The billionaire <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-04-06\/novogratz-says-bitcoin-will-go-to-the-moon-once-fed-pauses\">expects<\/a> that not only will the central bank raise interest rates due to the high inflation, but it will also likely raise these interest rates by as high as 50 basis points. However, this cannot continue on forever and the Fed will eventually need to ease up. This is when Novogratz predicts that bitcoin will go \u201cto the moon\u201d. This is what the billionaire expects will push the price of the digital asset as high as his $500,000 prediction.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/CqqSCYB9\/\" alt=\"Bitcoin price chart from TradingView.com\" width=\"3278\" height=\"1764\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC trading at $43,800 | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/TradingView.com\">BTCUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p class=\"p2\">Novogratz did not stop at $500,000 though. The Bitcoin proponent and maximalist also explained that he expects the digital asset to eventually reach as high as $1 million apiece.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Wary Of The Dollar<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">It seems bitcoin was not the only asset of concern for Novogratz during the Miami conference. He also touched upon the United States dollar as he expressed hope that the currency would continue to be strong instead of continuing to fall.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Piecing together the relationship between bitcoin and the dollar, the billionaire explained that the dollar going to infinity would mean Bitcoin going to infinity which would overall not be good for the Western world in any way.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-exchange-traded-products-near-1-of-total-btc-supply\/\">Bitcoin Exchange Traded Products Near 1% Of Total BTC Supply<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cI go to bed and I pray that the stewards of the U.S. economy don\u2019t screw it up,\u201d said Novogratz. \u201cI really do pray that the dollar is going to be strong and it doesn\u2019t go to infinity because Bitcoin going to infinity means the rest of the Western world has really fallen apart.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Galaxy Digital CEO had previously <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/when-bitcoin-at-500000-novogratz-says-five-years\/\">said<\/a> that he sees bitcoin going to $500,000.
