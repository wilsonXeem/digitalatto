The 25th Digital Financial Services Working Group (DFSWG) and the 18th SME Finance Working Group (SMEFWG) are <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.afi-global.org\/events\/digital-financial-services-sme-finance-working-group-meeting\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">both <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">taking place in San Salvador between May 16 and May 19.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) encompasses the two working groups. AFT is an organization based in Malaysia that is positioned as <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201ca policy leadership alliance owned and led by member central banks and financial regulatory institutions with the common objective of advancing financial inclusion at the country, regional and international levels.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AFI is cooperating with the Central Reserve Bank of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/el-salvador-president-bitcoin-city\/\">El Salvador<\/a> to host the meetings of the working groups.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the notion that these sessions will be primarily focused on Bitcoin (BTC) appears exaggerated, particularly because the AFI event website does not even include Bitcoin (BTC) or <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/market-cap-of-cryptocurrencies-is-800-billion-short\/\">cryptocurrencies<\/a> when outlining the topics that will be addressed by the working groups.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This misunderstanding has caused at least one country to clarify the situation. The central bank of Paraguay (BCP) said in a <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bcp.gov.py\/comunicado-sobre-participacion-del-bcp-en-foro-internacional-n1716\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on May 16 that although it is attending the SME Finance Working Group meeting, it is not particularly concentrated on cryptocurrency. A translated version of the Spanish-language BCP announcement says, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cthe focus of the meeting is not related to cryptocurrencies or the like.\u201d <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bank stated that it was issuing the explanation in response to reports that it will be attending an <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cinternational event about cryptocurrencies.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BCP then emphasized that Bitcoin (BTC) is not a legal currency in Paraguay, citing its previous statements on the subject from 2019. BCP additionally said that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201clikewise, the BCP does not plan to discuss cryptocurrencies in the said environment or meeting, a matter on which an institutional position has been established at the time.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As central bank heads address financial inclusion, cryptocurrencies have come up throughout working group sessions. Then again, financial officials in El Salvador are likely to be interested in how the nation\u2019s Bitcoin (BTC) adoption is progressing. However, as one media site put it, this is definitely not <em>\u201ca meeting that may best be described as the Davos for Bitcoin.\u201d<\/em> It is one of the numerous sessions conducted by the AFI every year that is mostly centered around financial inclusion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/central-bankers-el-salvador-bitcoin\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>President, Nayib Bukele, tweeted over the weekend that the country will host more than 40 countries this week to address issues such as the Bitcoin (BTC) adoption of El Salvator.
