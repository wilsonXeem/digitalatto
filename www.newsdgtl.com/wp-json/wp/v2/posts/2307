To keep things current, the NFTs will serve as trading cards which relate to the current season (Season 20) of the show, with each digital asset\u2019s utility being determined by the real-time ongoings of the show.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The American Idol NFT collection will drop on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ThetaDrop\">ThetaDrop<\/a> on 22nd April via $99 packs that each contain a random contestant from the top 14 of Season 20. The utility of the cards will then be manifested as Season 20 progresses in real time, where contestants will be eliminated from the competition. Holders will stand a chance of winning prizes if they own the NFTs of the contestants who survive.<\/p>\n<p>Just like the actual American Idol competition, the <strong>NFT concept<\/strong> will run a weekly scheduled set of competitions and prizes. Week 1 will see users who hold one of the top 10 performers receive an official 20th anniversary animated logo NFT.<\/p>\n<p>Week 2 will see holders of<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>two of the top 7 performers receive 300 $TDROP tokens via an airdrop. Week 3 will see those who hold three of the top 5 performers receive an American Idol Exclusive NFT. Week 4 will see those who hold two of the top 3 performers receive a \u2018VIP Bronze Benefits\u2019 set.<\/p>\n<p>In the final week, holders of the NFT which relates to the winner of <strong>American Idol Season 20<\/strong> will receive a \u2018Real American Idol Golden Ticket\u2019. From here, those who own a Golden Ticket will be entered into a raffle to win a \u2018Ticket to Hollywood NFT,\u2019 which, as its name suggests, will be an actual travel ticket to Hollywood.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Speaking on the innovative concept, Mitch Liu, the CEO of ThetaLabs, stated: <i>\u201cWhen you\u2019re collaborating with internationally-renowned entertainment brands, it doesn\u2019t get much bigger than American Idol. With our Theta-powered real-time predictive NFTs, fans will be able to go beyond voting for the contestants and become a judge, celebrating with their favourites and collecting rewards as they move through each qualifying round to the finals\u201d.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
