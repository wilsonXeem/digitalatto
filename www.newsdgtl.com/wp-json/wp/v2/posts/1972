This sidechain will operate with a synthetic version of ADA called wrapped ADA (wADA).<\/p>\n<p>In practice, this will allow users to leverage the Milkomeda sidechain and wADA to connect with Ethereum, as seen in the diagram below. This will remove friction from the process of trading ERC-20 tokens with native Cardano tokens. WingRiders <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@wingriderscom\/wingriders-will-launch-with-usdt-and-usdc-on-cardano-mainnet-btc-and-eth-coming-soon-847c3dd1a21e\">said<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Milkomeda itself is an EVM based side chain of Cardano \u2014 supporting the ERC20 tokens stored for the user (for example on their Flint wallet or again using Metamask). A gateway will lock these ERC-20 tokens then issue Cardano native equivalents of these tokens on to the Cardano blockchain. This can be done via the Flint wallet.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_488228\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-488228\" style=\"width: 850px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-488228 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Cardano-ADA-ADAUSDT.png\" alt=\"Cardano ADA ADAUSDT\" width=\"850\" height=\"300\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-488228\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Wingriders<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Bitcoin And Ethereum To Integrate With Cardano (ADA)?<\/h2>\n<p>As WingRiders explained, the tokens on one side of the two chains will enter a smart contract to be \u201clocked\u201d as the synthetic versions are minted on the other side. In the case of the stablecoins, these digital assets will be \u201cpre-mined\u201d before the user request them and they will be \u201clocked on the Cardano mainnet\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>In that way, users can benefit from a \u201csimple\u201d way to transact on this network. Stablecoin is some of the most important digital assets because it can operate as a \u201cliquidity accelerator\u201d and onboard new users, fresh capital, and new assets, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, to the ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>However, bridges have become objects of attack by bad actors. Some of the biggest DeFi hacks in recent times have occurred on these platforms. Therefore, the potential for this partnership and ADA\u2019s performance seems great, but not without potential tradeoffs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/all\/heres-wy-ada-could-replicate-ethereums-2017-bullish-breakout\/\">Here\u2019s Why ADA Could Replicate Ethereum\u2019s 2017 bullish\u00a0break-out\u00a0<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The inventor of Cardano trusts the team behind the initiative.
