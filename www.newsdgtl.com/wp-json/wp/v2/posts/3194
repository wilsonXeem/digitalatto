However, the move has almost fully retraced. What\u2019s interesting about the situation, is that traders at one particular platform could have seen this coming a lot more clearly, while others might have suffered a fake out.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a closer look at a comparison between BTCUSD spot index price charts and BTC CME Futures that puts a spotlight on the strange discrepancy. We also shed some light on how to possibly take advantage when these instances occur.<\/p>\n<h2>Why You Can\u2019t Ever Sleep On Crypto Markets<\/h2>\n<p>The crypto market never sleeps. It trades night and day, 24\/7 days a week. Even stock market futures take a break for short periods. But when it comes to CME Group\u2019s <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin-may-drop-until-it-fills-cme-btc-futures-gap-at-8500\/\">BTC futures contracts<\/a>, it more closely follows the stock market\u2019s trading hours.<\/p>\n<p>CME takes a break from Friday to Sunday evening. If Bitcoin price moves substantially during the time the trading desk is offline, it will <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin-may-drop-until-it-fills-cme-btc-futures-gap-at-8500\/\">leave a gap<\/a> on its chart that regularly becomes a target that gets \u201cfilled\u201d in the following days.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/bitcoin-indicator-hits-historical-low-not-seen-since-2015\/\">Bitcoin Indicator Hits Historical Low Not Seen Since 2015<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Because certain spot market trading days are missing from the CME BTC futures chart, certain <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/bitcoin-indicator-hits-historical-low-not-seen-since-2015\/\">technical indicators<\/a> can produce minor deviations. More often than not, these minor discrepancies are early signs that a fake out is coming.<\/p>\n<p>Need proof? In the chart below, we\u2019ve compared the BTCUSD spot price index, BTC CME futures, and SPX futures. Bitcoin\u2019s spot index produced a bullish crossover of the LMACD yesterday, while the CME chart remained bearish. Interestingly, the CME chart more closely mimics the popular US stock market index.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-489820 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/SPX_2022-05-05_11-22-32-860x394.png\" alt=\"SPX_2022-05-05_11-22-32\" width=\"860\" height=\"394\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC CME futures performs more on par with the stock market | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/BTCUSD\/\">BTCUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2>How To Potentially Predict Bitcoin Fake Outs Using Spot Vs CME Comparison<\/h2>\n<p>The LMACD \u2013 the logarithmic version of the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/topic\/macd\/\">Moving Average Convergence Divergence<\/a> indicator \u2013 is considered a lagging indicator. For this reason, bullish or bearish crossovers are typically considered reliable signals to take or close a position.<\/p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t clear if the discrepancy above happened naturally due to the missing trading days from the chart, or if something else was at play. The crossover appears to have been used as a bull trap, clearing out any last minute longs. Momentum on the daily is currently bearish again, so there is risk of continued downside until it turns up again.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/time-vs-price-bitcoin-correction\/\">Time Vs Price: Why This Bitcoin Correction Was The Most Painful Yet<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Traders need not ditch the indicator altogether, but instead can use such discrepancies between the two indicator\u2019s performance to try and predict when fake outs, stop runs, or <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/return-of-darth-maul-bitcoin-price-pumps-and-dumps-in-5-shakeout\/\">other nasty moves will occur<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The last time the LMACD produced a false signal on spot exchanges, yet not on the CME BTC chart, was the exact peak in November 2021.
