This allows developers to access all Ethereum tools and features while still benefiting from the network\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. As Evmos is built on top of the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/evmos.blog\/\">Cosmos SDK<\/a>, it can also interact and exchange value with the rest of the Cosmos Ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>It is well known the importance and necessity of blockchain oracles to fuel DeFi applications.<\/p>\n<p>Oracles, as bridges between off-chain and on-chain systems, are the third-party software in charge of feeding smart contracts with real-time data to execute their underlying transactions. Through this integration, DIA is enabling developers on Evmos to have access to data feeds for 6.000+ cryptocurrency assets to build dApps.<\/p>\n<p>To provide such a large data offering, unlike other Web3 oracle providers, DIA sources data directly from CEXs and DEXs at a very granular level. This enables DIA to create oracles for any asset that is available on centralised and decentralised markets. Additionally, this multi-source and granular approach allows DIA to create very robust and resilient oracles while providing full transparency.<\/p>\n<p>Evmos is the latest blockchain network that DIA has integrated with and joins a list of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.diadata.org\/developers\">20+ blockchains DIA is available on<\/a>, including Fantom, Arbitrum, Solana, Polkadot, Metis and NEAR, among others.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/company\/dias-open-source-oracles-live-on-evmos-mainnet\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The open-source oracle platform for Web3, DIA announced today its entry into the newly launched Evmos ecosystem by making its data infrastructure available on its mainnet network.
