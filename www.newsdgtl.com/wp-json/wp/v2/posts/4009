It is a computationally-intensive process that opens doors for validators (who validate transactions) to earn rewards. Validators verify the transaction by guessing a unique hash number associated with each transaction. And it requires computing power more than simple PCs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/new-data-shows-china-still-controls-21-of-the-global-bitcoin-mining-hashrate\/\">New Data Shows China Still Controls 21% Of The Global Bitcoin Mining Hashrate<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Similarly, it needs a more powerful computer when verifying transactions on the Bitcoin network.
