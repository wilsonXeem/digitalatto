The coin had managed to keep prices above the $14 support level for the past three months but at the moment, DOT was about to break through the support line.<\/p>\n<p>This has also suggested a fall in buying strength and that has caused prices to travel southwards. The volume of assets exchanged was seen in red and the bar was taller than the previous one which could mean an increase in selling pressure.<\/p>\n<p>DOT is trading on a three-month low price level and fall from this level would mean that it would trade near the $13.70 price mark. In case of a price reversal, the immediate resistance for the coin stood at $15.40 and then at $16.68.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/polkadot-vechain-founders-pledge-over-10-million-in-crypto-to-ukraine\/\">Polkadot, Vechain Founders Pledge Over $10 Million In Crypto To Ukraine<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Technical Analysis<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_489605\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-489605\" style=\"width: 1822px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-489605 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/DOTUSD_2022-05-04_02-09-03.png\" alt=\"Polkadot\" width=\"1822\" height=\"709\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-489605\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Polkadot displays a fall in buying strength on the four hour chart.
