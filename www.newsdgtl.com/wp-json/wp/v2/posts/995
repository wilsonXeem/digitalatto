While the market was down, fear was all over the place. People began to panic sell and doubt the market. This usually happens after the end of each bull run. Let\u2019s quickly break this down while we are at it. During a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bearish-bullish-meaning-in-cryptocurrency\/\">bull run<\/a>, the cryptocurrency market is full of hype and attention. This helps the market grow in value and attracts a ton of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/investing-vs-trading-crypto\/\">investors<\/a>. However, the higher the market goes, the harder it falls. This was the case with the last market correction when <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin<\/a> hit a low of $33,000.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, the people who invest when the market is at its peak are often left with losses. Because of this, fear begins to spread and more people start selling their <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">crypto<\/a>. This causes a chain reaction and the market usually continues to lose its money.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, as the market is slowly recovering, people are starting to invest in it again. Throughout this article, we will present our ApeCoin price prediction 2030. Throughout the article, we will do our best to explain what <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/apecoin-price-prediction-2022\/\">ApeCoin<\/a> is and what does the future hold for this token.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is ApeCoin?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In essence, ApeCoin is an <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a> token that made its debut in March 2022. This makes it one of the youngest tokens in the market. ApeCoin is a governance and utility token that will power the Yuga Labs ecosystem. The team behind ApeCoin claims that they want ApeCoin to be at the forefront of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-web3\/\">Web 3<\/a>. Through the ApeCoin <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-dao\/\">DAO<\/a> and the Ape Foundation, Yuga Labs promotes decentralization and collaboration between projects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After ApeCoin\u2019s debut, Yuga Labs tweeted a video teasing its upcoming <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-and-metaverse\/\">Metaverse<\/a> known as the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Otherside<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This video included <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-nft-non-fungible-tokens\/\">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)<\/a> such as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptopunks-why-are-cryptopunks-so-expensive\/\">CryptoPunks<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bored-apes-price\/\">Bored Apes<\/a>, World of Women, and MeeBits. Taking that into consideration, the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Otherside <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metaverse will include these NFT collections as well; and ApeCoin will power it. On the 16th of March 2022, the official Twitter account of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-a-bored-ape\/\">BAYC<\/a> tweeted a teaser for the upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) game they are working on; Yuga Labs later retweeted it. This might be a sign that this Play-to-Earn game could be a part of the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Otherside <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metaverse.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"und\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/5M7Y4qZRc9\">https:\/\/t.co\/5M7Y4qZRc9<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/AEeo6TkzLW\">pic.twitter.com\/AEeo6TkzLW<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Bored Ape Yacht Club (@BoredApeYC) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BoredApeYC\/status\/1504213745840631820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 16, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ApeCoin Price Prediction 2030<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the future of ApeCoin, we can say that it is one of the brightest in the market. Considering everything that we mentioned above, ApeCoin could break records in the upcoming years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We at <\/span><b><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/category\/price-prediction\/\">CryptoAcademy<\/a> <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">believe that ApeCoin is likely to become one of the 20 biggest cryptocurrencies in the market in terms of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\">market capitalization<\/a>. By the end of 2022, ApeCoin could reach a trading value of $60, maybe even $80 if the market is bullish. However, the next few years might not be easy for this token. By 2025, ApeCoin might hit a price of around $120. As we move farther from today, its price is likely to continue to increase. By the end of 2027, this <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/token-meaning-what-is-a-cryptocurrency-token\/\">token<\/a> is likely to surpass the $200 milestone. By the time 2030 rolls around, ApeCoin could be sitting at a trading value of around $300-$350.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, ApeCoin might experience a 30x by 2030. This is, of course, considering how the market usually moves. Moreover, we are making these predictions based on the current tokenomics and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-circulating-supply-and-maximum-supply\/\">maximum supply<\/a> of ApeCoin. If this project implements a burning mechanism on its <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-tokenomics\/\">tokenomics<\/a>, then it might go even higher. We have also presented our <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/ape-price-forecast\/\">APE price forecast<\/a> some days ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24050\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24050\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24050\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"ApeCoin Price Prediction 2030 Chart by Crypto Academy\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-7.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24050\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-7.png\" alt=\"ApeCoin Price Prediction 2030 Chart by Crypto Academy\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24050\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>ApeCoin Price Prediction 2030.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeaways<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of March 2022, the cryptocurrency market is full of fear.
