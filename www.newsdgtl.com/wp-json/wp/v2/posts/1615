As a new asset class, it has the potential to attract billions in capital from multiple sectors and revolutionize its business model by empowering its owners.<\/p>\n<p>This is the objective of Landshare Real Estate NFTs, powered by its Asset Tokenization Technology. A first in the NFT sector, Landshare enables its holders to own real-world property on the blockchain and generate a yield.<\/p>\n<p>In that way, investors can generate double value by owning a real-world asset, collecting monthly income, and generating a yield by earning LAND NFTs. The extra rewards can amount to as much as a 40% extra Annual Percentage Rate (APR).<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, an investment in the traditional real estate sector could yield around 4% annually. In addition to the 40% APY mentioned, Landshare NFTs provides its users with a staking system that can boost rewards to as much as 57%.<\/p>\n<p>This represents a 1225% increase in terms of a typical real estate investment. As a bonus, users can skip management fees, third parties, and maintenance fees, and make their investment more efficient in terms of capital by leveraging Landshare\u2019s NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>The company is set on creating a new mechanism to invest in a real state by bringing these two sectors. This will make it more accessible for investors around the world to access the market.<\/p>\n<p>In the current macro-economic environment, with a U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) recording a multi-decade high, suggesting persistent inflation, an investor\u2019s capacity to generate yield will be critical. Landshare Real Estate NFTs have opened the door to combining both the digital and the physical world.<\/p>\n<h3>Maximizing Your Rewards With Landshare\u2019s Real Estate NFTs<\/h3>\n<p>An investment on Landshare can cost you as little as $50 by taking advantage of the blockchain, you can access the property via fractional real estate investment. In other words, you don\u2019t have to risk millions on a single property, investors can diversify their real estate portfolio and own a fraction of multiple real-world assets on the blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, Landshare Real Estate NFTs yields can be compounded with their Play-to-Earn model. This will allow users to generate LAND tokens which can be multiplied by upgrading the digital property with resources provided by the Landshare ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>This Play-to-Earn model (P2E) will maintain this real-world-like feature. In that way, an owner can generate more yield for improving and owning a nice property. The P2E incentivizes them to do so.<\/p>\n<p>The model will follow popular games builders and managers, such as The Sims. This will require owners to use limited resources to produce, repair, or renovate their properties and multiply their LAND token production.<\/p>\n<p>The Landshare ecosystem will have its own entities that will produce the resources, a Lumber Mill, a Brick Factory, a Concrete Plant, and more. This will add up to the bringing of the physical into the digital world and will keep owners on their feet to generate more rewards.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/company\/how-landshare-real-estate-nfts-will-let-your-earn-yield-from-real-world-assets\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have created new opportunities for investors.
