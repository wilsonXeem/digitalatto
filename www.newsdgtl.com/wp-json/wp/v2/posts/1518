In essence, a crypto launchpad serves as a real-life launchpad, but here, you launch a token, not a rocket\u2026 obviously. Lately, DeFi launchpads have been all over the place. However, only a few of them are effective and credible, with one of the leading ones being <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pinksale.finance\/#\/\">PinkSale<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PinkSale Finance is a living example of how a project can contribute to the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-decentralized-finance\/\">DeFi<\/a> ecosystem. Their platform has a considerable amount of decentralization and a very high level of security. To make its platform as self-sustainable as possible, PinkSale has its own token, the PinkSale coin known as PINKSALE. Without further adieu, let us take a closer look at their token.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is PinkSale Coin (PINKSALE)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PinkSale is a launchpad protocol that supports more than 7 <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchain<\/a> networks. They also support 2 blockchains that are still on testnet. Moving on, this platform has a number of features that make it stand out. Through PinkSale, you can launchpads, PinkPads, Airdrops, and even tokens. The platform of PinkSale is powered by their native token, the PinkSale Coin.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The PinkSale Coin was created solely for the PinkSale Finance platform. Using this token, PinkSale Finance aims to make its platform somewhat self-sustainable. That is why this token is prioritizing increasing its exposure. At the time of writing, you can purchase this token on PancakeSwap and Hoo. PancakeSwap is the biggest <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-smart-chain-bsc\/\">Binance Smart Chain (BSC)<\/a> decentralized exchange while Hoo is a major centralized exchange.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokenomics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned before, this token\u2019s purpose is to power PinkSale\u2019s platform. So, the goals of this token are long-term, meaning that the team of the token designed this token for the long run. The <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-tokenomics\/\">tokenomics<\/a> of PinkSale Coin are also designed for the long run.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-circulating-supply-and-maximum-supply\/\">Maximum Supply<\/a>: 100,000 tokens<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Token Distribution:<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">16% goes to the team wallet<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8% goes to the marketing wallet<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6% goes to the advisory wallet<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40% goes to users as rewards<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12% goes to ecosystem development <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-wallet-definition\/\">wallet<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6% goes towards exchange liquidity<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rest was distributed in the public and private sale round<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with these statistics, the team of PinkSale coin will use 20% of their profits to buy PINKSALE to burn them. The process of burning usually helps a token become as deflationary as possible which often affects the price positively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of writing, the PinkSale coin is <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/investing-vs-trading-crypto\/\">trading<\/a> at a price of $160, with a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/understanding-crypto-trading-volume\/\">trading volume<\/a> of $110,000. Its fully diluted <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\">market capitalization<\/a> is sitting at $17 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PinkSale Launchpad<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use your PINKSALE on the official website of PinkSale in several ways. The main one, of course, is creating a launchpad or purchasing tokens from a launchpad. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to launch a token and you need an efficient and secure launchpad protocol to do so, simply purchase some PINKSALE, go to their website, and proceed to follow their guide.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, you can use <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/pinksale\/\">PINKSALE<\/a> to buy tokens from other launchpads as well. Purchasing a token in a launchpad is way riskier than purchasing a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/token-meaning-what-is-a-cryptocurrency-token\/\">token<\/a> that has been on the market for months. But, investing in launchpads is nearly always a high-risk, high-reward type of investment. If the launchpad of a project fails to reach its soft cap, the investment that you made will be returned, of course. However, the real risk comes after the launchpad is successful because then, you won\u2019t have PinkSale to ensure your safety.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeaways<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each day, more and more DeFi launchpads are joining the market, but only a few of them are decent.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PinkSale is one of the leading launchpad protocols in the DeFi ecosystem.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PinkSale Finance has its own token known as PinkSale Coin (PINKSALE).<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This token is designed in such a way that it promotes the longevity of the project.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\">\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/shibaswifecommunity\"><img src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" style=\"width:auto ;height:auto;\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/1649344972_991_ShibasWifeBannerGif3-1.gif\"\/><noscript><img src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/1649344972_991_ShibasWifeBannerGif3-1.gif\" style=\"width:auto ;height:auto;\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/pinksale-coin\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you ever thought of launching your own token, you might have stumbled upon the term launchpad.
