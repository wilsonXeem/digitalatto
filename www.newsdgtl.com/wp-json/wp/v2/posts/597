Following the NFT market\u2019s record breaking <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$10.7 billion in sales<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last quarter, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/doingud.com\/\">DoinGud<\/a> hopes its platform will incentivize more projects to donate and align with charitable or social causes for more positive impact.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe are just scratching the surface on NFTs\u2019 potential to empower communities, nonprofits and social causes,\u201d said Manu Alzuru, DoinGud founder. \u201cThe art world is experiencing a huge shift with digital creations. Creatives are quitting their jobs and building communities full time thanks\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to the rapid growth of the NFT market and DAOs. Now, those same creatives are looking to align their mission with positive social outreach. Through DoinGud, leading artists are delegating large portions of their proceeds to amazing organizations that are generating positive social impact.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The platform was launched this week in celebration of\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.givingtuesday.org\/\">Giving Tuesday, <\/a>the day after Cyber Monday and Black Friday weekend, which is<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarded as the world\u2019s largest day of generosity. It was created in 2012 as a simple idea: a day that encourages people to do good. Over the past nine years, this idea has grown into a global movement that inspires hundreds of millions of people and has turned into a global movement centering around giving, collaborating, and celebrating generosity. Last year, patrons donated more than <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$2.7 billion<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to U.S. nonprofits. The current NFT boom has given rise to a new way for people to donate to nonprofits and do good for the planet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DoinGud incentivizes creators to donate a portion of their proceeds on every sale and streamlines the process with all donations being transparent and on-chain. Not only can creators choose to allocate up to 100% of their initial sale to humanitarian efforts; they can also allocate a percentage of royalties from each secondary market sale to fund charitable causes in perpetuity. Creators also benefit from 0% minting and platform fees. The DoinGud platform itself is environmentally conscious by utilizing \u201clazy-minting\u201d where NFTs are only minted once they are purchased.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cUnited Way is helping more people rebuild their lives better and stronger after the economic fallout of COVID-19 and other crises,\u201d said Edwin Goutier, Vice President of Innovation for United Way Worldwide. \u201cGiving to United Way through DoinGud means those who are in need will get the help they need, including food, shelter and access to essential mental health services. Our community is strongest when we\u2019re United and we are grateful to DoinGud for providing a modern platform for uniting the community.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p><script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n!function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s){if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?\nn.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;\nn.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;\nt.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window,\ndocument,'script','https:\/\/connect.facebook.net\/en_US\/fbevents.js');\n<\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.the-blockchain.com\/2021\/12\/02\/doingud-launches-its-first-charitable-nft-collection-in-collaboration-with-h-creative\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>DoinGud, an NFT ecosystem focused on inspiring creativity and positive social impact, launched its full platform featuring NFT artists from H+ Creative, a women led boutique creative studio that represents a tight-knit roster of top-tier, diverse international artists.
