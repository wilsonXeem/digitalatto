The Sky Mavis Bug Bounty program is here. Help us keep the <\/span><span class=\"r-18u37iz\">Ronin Network <\/span><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\">secure while earning a bounty u<\/span>p to $1,000,000 in bounty for fatal bugs.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>The Ronin Hack<\/h2>\n<p>On March 23rd, a hacker was able to scoop $600 million from the Ronin bridge. It is the largest hack in the history of decentralized finances so far. The Ronin Network team <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/roninblockchain.substack.com\/p\/community-alert-ronin-validators?s=w\">confirmed<\/a> that Sky Mavis\u2019s Ronin validator nodes and Axie DAO validator nodes were compromised as the attacker used \u201chacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The attack was uncovered after the attacker was unable to withdraw 5k ETH from the bridge. But it was too late, as they had already drained 173,600 Ethereum and 25.5M USDC from the Ronin bridge in two transactions.<\/p>\n<p>The Ronin team stated that they are working with law enforcement officials, forensic cryptographers, and investors \u201cto make sure all funds are recovered or reimbursed,\u201d and added that \u201cAll of the AXS, RON, and SLP on Ronin are safe right now.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWhile racing for mainstream adoption, we made some trade-offs that ended up leaving us vulnerable to this sort of attack. It\u2019s a lesson that we\u2019ve learned the hard way. A lesson that will guide how we build Ronin out moving forward. We\u2019re confident that we will come out stronger and wiser from this.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>As a response, the Sky Mavis team raised $150 million led by crypto exchange\u00a0Binance with participation from Animoca Brands, a16z, Dialectic, Paradigm, with the goal to reimburse all the funds stolen during the hack to the affected users.<\/p>\n<p>Since then, the team has been working with Chainalysis and Crowdstrike \u201cto monitor the stolen funds\u201d and \u201cto handle forensics and the setup of surveillance tools.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bridges can be a vulnerable point for blockchain projects, and this hack set a big warning about it. Bridges connect blockchains with the purpose of enabling transactions between tokens built on different ecosystems. However, bridges have a complex code and don\u2019t have enough security standards yet, and hackers are gazing upon them to spot any vulnerability.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/ethereum\/hacker-scoops-up-2-million-bounty-after-spotting-fatal-flaw-in-ethereum-rollup\/\">Hacker Scoops Up $2 Million Bounty After Spotting Fatal Flaw In Ethereum Rollup<\/a><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>$1M Bounty<\/h2>\n<p>Bridges can be so complex that it is not 100% clear if code auditing is enough to ensure the Ronin bridge\u2019s safety. The Ronin team had stated that they are in the process of \u201cimplementing rigorous internal security measures to prevent future attacks.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe Ronin Network bridge will open once it has undergone a security upgrade and several audits, which can take several weeks.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Now, they are calling in all white-hat hackers of the blockchain to search for vulnerabilities in exchange for a handsome reward. The team has <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/skymavis.notion.site\/Sky-Mavis-Bug-Bounty-Program-ef33b18c4ee14eaab4698a8efd2c9992\">given<\/a> a list of products that should be stress-tested while prioritizing smart contracts and blockchain, websites, and apps. They noted that the only vulnerabilities that are <span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"0\" data-reactroot=\"\">considered eligible for monetary rewards are those<\/span><span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"0\" data-reactroot=\"\"> with a working proof of concept that shows how they can be exploited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Rewards for <span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"0\" data-reactroot=\"\">Smart Contracts and Blockchain vary from $1,000 to $1,000,000, and for Web and Apps, they vary from $50 to $15,000. All rewards will be paid in AXS tokens and only a specified portion of the received funds can be liquidated per month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"0\" data-reactroot=\"\">\u201cI<\/span>t is possible that extraordinarily severe issues or those with extreme impact may be rewarded up to $1,000,000\u2033 the announcement stated and added that \u201cSky Mavis may award an additional reward bonus for exceptional reports.\u00b7<\/p>\n<h2>Axie Infinity (AXS) Price<\/h2>\n<p>For the past weeks, Axie Infinity\u2019s token AXS has been tumbling, falling around 30% after the hack. However, traders are watching out for a breakout above the key resistance level of $58 as the current zone has previously served for accumulation, which could mean a rebound for AXS. However, there also seems to be a risk to trigger a head-and-shoulders pattern, which could sink AXS further down. The token is down 0.09% in the last 24 hours.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/token\/axie-infinity-smooth-love-potion-slp-explodes\/\">Axie Infinity Smooth Love Potion (SLP) Explodes With 300% Gain This February<\/a><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_488021\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-488021\" style=\"width: 1194px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-488021\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/AXSUSDT_2022-04-12_20-31-09.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1194\" height=\"553\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-488021\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">AXS at 47 USDT in the daily chart | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/mvB0dNvE\/?symbol=BINANCE%3AAXSUSDT\">AXSUSDT on TradingView.com<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/the-ronin-hack-aftermatch-axie-infinity-1m-bug-bounty\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The popular blockchain game Axie Infinity has been left shaking after the $650 million Ronin bridge hack.
