BTC seems to be trading in a range above the $39,000 level and below the $41,500 resistance zone.<\/p>\n<p>The last swing low was formed near $39,600 before the price started an upside correction.

To start a recovery wave, the price must clear the $40,380 zone and the 100 hourly SMA. In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise towards the $40,850 resistance zone. Any more gains could set the pace for a move towards the main $41,500 hurdle in the near term.<\/p>\n<h2>More Losses in BTC?<\/h2>\n<p>If bitcoin fails to clear the $40,180 resistance zone, it could start another decline. An immediate support on the downside is near the $39,600 level.<\/p>\n<p>The next major support is seen near the $39,180 level. A downside break below the $39,180 support zone could accelerate losses.
