It truly is the most exciting time to be in DeFi.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Built on Polygon, the Gains Network provides an innovative full-suite DeFi ecosystem including rewards via its deflationary token, $GNS, deeply integrated non-fungible tokens (NFTs), staking pools that provide value and high returns, and decentralized leveraged trading via the gTrade platform.<\/p>\n<p>According to the team, the latest launch of leveraged trading of stock prices will provide users with cutting-edge technology, a user-friendly UI\/UX, high leverage, and a superior user experience. First, there will be no funding or borrowing fees, allowing users to make as much profit as possible. Secondly, users will be provided with high leverage of up to 150x, which is also offered on crypto assets on gTrade. Finally, the platform has integrated Chainlink\u2019s decentralized oracles to provide real-time and trustless stock prices to the platform.<\/p>\n<p>To ensure smooth trading and increased liquidity, gTrade uses an innovative synthetic leveraged trading architecture powered by the $GNS utility token. The platform has two liquidity pools that help execute trades for all assets listed on gTrade which reduces the need to build out a liquidity pool for every pair. The leverage provided to traders on the platform is synthetic, which unlocks a much higher degree of liquidity efficiency. Furthermore, the platform ensures reduced liquidation risk, no scam wicks, and no price impacts on the trades.<\/p>\n<p>In the coming weeks and months, gTrade will add support for virtually all US-listed stocks, opening up the platform to more users. Every significant publicly traded stock will be listed in the future and be available for leveraged price trading.<\/p>\n<p>The leveraged trading of the three front-running US stocks on gTrade ($GOOG, $AAPL, and $FB) went live on May 2nd, 2022 at market open.
