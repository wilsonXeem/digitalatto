This all-in-one cryptocurrency platform and the Crypto.org chain have their native token, Cronos, formed to improve security and simplify its utility and access to the cryptocurrency space. It also wanted to ensure the absolute control of people on their identity, data, and assets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ultimate aim was to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies globally. It instantly embarked on energetic campaigns to practically implement its mission of transitioning the world with cryptocurrency. Cronos is unique, especially due to its biggest attraction of making a series of bold moves making it look similar to a traditional finance company. However, it is establishing itself as a true and top-rated secure finance company in major markets, including the United States, Singapore, and others.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cronos (CRO) Fundamental Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crypto.com has recently announced the launch of its personal open-source <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchain<\/a> for the public, as previously, it is an <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a>-based token. The native token has a very easy-to-use and portable platform for Ethereum and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/ethereum-virtual-machine-explained\/\">EVM<\/a>-compatible chains related to fast port apps. It provides access to their fast-growing global user base of more than ten million. Its EVM fund grants about $1 million for each project. They are built upon Ethermint, making the instant port of apps and smart contracts through Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains possible. It also lets the users pay more for online merchants and acts as an intermediary currency for sometimes letting the users convert the cryptocurrency.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cronos is fast, cheap, and scalable as it has the ability to process a higher number of transactions per minute than Ethereum and executes <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/smart-contracts\/\">smart contracts<\/a> easily. The system becomes interoperable due to its Inter Blockchain Communications (IBC) protocol that bridges the Crypto.org Chain and other IBC-enabled chains, such as Cosmos Hub. It uses a proof of authority consensus mechanism, as it is more streamlined, scalable, and secure with several validators run by various parties. Being an open-source blockchain, they allow their community to give reviews and suggestions for the improvement and strength of Cronos. So, it simply uses decentralized technology to provide fast transactions with lower fees to support investors and merchants.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cronos Play unites with ChainSafe Gaming SDK easily with a few lines of code to support the Unity game engine and more in the future. This gaming feature provides insightful on-chain data, authenticated and authorized wallets, and the transfer of tokens and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-nft-non-fungible-tokens\/\">NFTs<\/a> in their game. The multi-platform system supports the games in development on multiple engines, including Unity and Unreal. Cronos works along with the top blockchain startup accelerator named Cronos Labs for scale-up adoption. So it is providing access and native interoperability to Cosmos through IBC protocol and extending its 10M + users community globally.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Cronos works<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Crypto.org chain was created by the community of Crypto.com to build a nexus of cryptocurrency projects, especially the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-decentralized-finance\/\">decentralized finance<\/a> (DeFi), and to facilitate and convince the merchants to use crypto as a payment method. Being the native token of Crypto.org Chain and Cronos, CRO stimulates the formation of blockchain solutions on its platform. In addition, it also ensures the security of its network by staking. Since its beginning, it has been used by Crypto.com to offer a lot of rewards and discounts to its users by offering access to its flagship credit card product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the growth of Crypto.com as an ecosystem of crypto solutions, CRO added the advantages to customers, including lower trading fees and higher lending rewards. While transitioning into the main token of the Cronos blockchains and Crypto.org Chain, CRO not only retained its uses within the Crypto.com system but also spread among the community as the main payment method for transactions on this blockchain.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokenomics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bobby Bao, Gary Or, Kris Marszalek, and Rafael Melo were the initial founders of crypto.com, one of the largest crypto exchanges. CRO blockchain mainly tries to focus on providing payment, financial service solutions, and trading utility to Crypto.com. Hence, it also acts as the tool to empower Crypto.com\u2019s drive that facilitates the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies globally. CRO tokens have a total supply of 30 billion tokens, and there is a preplanned allocation of these coins for different uses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since November 2018, 30% of the coins have been used for launch incentives and secondary distribution, which get released in batches daily for five years. 20% will be used as capital reserve and for long-term network incentives that will be frozen till November 2022, for ecosystem grants that will be frozen until the launch of Crypto.com Chain Mainnet each. For community development, 10% of the CRO coins are used.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roadmap<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their roadmap regarding features is associated with Crypto.com Pay, OAuth, and NFT. Crypto Pay is linked with the leading payment gateway to begin accepting crypto and credit cards. Crypto.com OAuth login will be used to bring millions and millions of end-users to the gaming community. It will also try to turn into a leading NFT platform for assisting users in managing, trading, and minting digital collectibles. In the real engine plugin, they will support C++ and Blueprint and enable direct connection with Cronos. Also, through their C++ development SDK, they will try to create a community game with much-needed features.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cronos (CRO) Price Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At present, the price of Cronos is $0.30, with a trading volume of about $60 million.

It is a specialized marketplace for cryptocurrency purchases while working as a stock trading platform.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 1: Create an Account<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, you should make an account on a cryptocurrency exchange. You can use choose the right exchange by considering their fees, methods of transactions, customer reviews, support, easy usability, and registration in your locality. You can know whatever information is needed by clicking on the name of the exchange. Most exchanges need your email, phone number, and photo ID.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 2: Select a Payment Method<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depositing money is among the major events during any exchange, and it has to be convenient for the buyer. Payment through local banks is usually free, so you can do it if the exchange you are using allows this method. You can know the details from the \u2018view details\u2019 region. If you choose payment through credit or debit card, you should be aware that although it provides a convenient transaction, instant purchase, or sets up a recurring purchase, it also takes an additional fee for providing these additional services. If you already have a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or a stablecoin, stored with you, you can trade it with CRO by checking the compatibility of the exchange you are using for that trade.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 3: Fulfill the requirements<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most cryptocurrency exchanges will ask you to verify your identity through a process called Know Your Customer (KYC) before funding your account and trading cryptocurrencies, like Cronos. Different platforms make you go through different KYC processes that mostly require a photo ID and a webcam or smartphone. Some platforms might also require you to upload your bank statement, credit card statement, or a preprinted paystub from an employer to prove your address. However, you can avoid a KYC process in some exchanges. But such exchanges do not allow you to trade or deposit cryptocurrency using your local currency and your bank account. So if you want to use US dollars for purchasing CRO, you have to go through a KYC process. We suggest you enable two-factor authentication (2FA) after verifying your identity, as it will further secure your account and save your funds.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 4: Buy Cronos<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you are now well prepared for purchasing CRO and the simplest way to do so is using the \u2018instant buy\u2019 feature. You can purchase CRO at a set price on some exchanges after comparing it with other exchanges. You can also open trade in the spot market, just like most people, where you can set your own price. The instant buy feature is easy-to-use and straightforward but is more costly than using the spot market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After choosing the purchase option, you should check the market conditions before making the actual purchase so that you know the right time for buying the crypto and at the right rates. Also, check the Analysis tab on this page, as it also gives an idea of all the recent price performances of Cronos.
