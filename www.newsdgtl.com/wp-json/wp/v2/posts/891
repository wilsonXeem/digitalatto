Trading firm QCP Capital believes the bullish price action comes from the positive reaction to the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) increase in interest rates.<\/p>\n<p>The financial institution began to tighten its monetary policy and hinted at further rates hikes. Bitcoin and Ethereum reacted to the upside as the FED acted within expectations and investors felt more clarity.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, ETH\u2019s price seems to be benefiting from the apparent imminent deployment of \u201cThe Merge\u201d. An event is set to combine Ethereum\u2019s execution layer with its consensus layer, and fully unlock the network\u2019s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) potential.<\/p>\n<p>As ETH is set to reduce its energy consumption, to implement new scaling solutions, a pseudonym analyst called CroissantEth attempted to break down these \u201cfundamental changes\u201d to the network. In addition, the analyst tried to point out the new trends to watch as Eth 2.0 comes into the picture.<\/p>\n<p>The analyst <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CroissantEth\/status\/1508455422818230279\">said<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\ud835\ude19\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35, \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude1b\ud835\ude0f 2.0 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude25? No. Not just any. We\u2019ve already talked about ETH 2.0. In this thread I will focus specifically on game-changers. Things that are only made possible thanks to ETH 2.0 &amp; the upgrades it introduces.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Ethereum To Enter A New Era<\/h2>\n<p>At the top of the list, and one of the reasons why Ethereum has seen an increase in institutional interest, the analyst mentioned the potential introduction of staking pools for ETH. The asset will increase its potential as a yield generator and holders will be able to earn transaction fees and extra rewards.<\/p>\n<p>This could potentially impact ETH\u2019s adoption levels and increase inactive users. In addition, the analyst highlighted the introduction of staking derivatives that could provide users with further incentives to lock ETH.<\/p>\n<p>This could contribute to the ETH as a deflationary asset narrative and potentially triggered a supply shock for this digital asset. Rewards and incentives will be a big part of Eth 2.0 together with scalability. On the latter, the analyst said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cross-chain stuff is cool &amp; all, but how about cross-rollup tooling? This is something people have not watched closely enough. dApps that bridge the gap between optimistic &amp; zkrollups have a great future ahead of them.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Optimism and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs technology could potentially allow Ethereum to scale and process thousands of transactions per second. This has been the biggest driver for ETH \u201cKillers\u201d, but the trend could reverse if people have access to cheaper ETH transactions.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">9. Privacy<\/p>\n<p>I couldn\u2019t mention zkproofs without mentioning privacy, right?<\/p>\n<p>Our privacy should be of utmost importance to us.<\/p>\n<p>zkproofs enable zero knowledge verification of arbitrary functions without disclosing underlying info. This is huge.<\/p>\n<p>Ex. .<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Sismo_eth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Sismo_eth<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/2voucJ86cD\">pic.twitter.com\/2voucJ86cD<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 croissant (@CroissantEth) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CroissantEth\/status\/1508455457572233225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 28, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Related Reading |<\/strong> <strong><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-welcomes-another-crypto-winter\/\">Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Welcomes Another Crypto Winter<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The analyst named other trends that have the power to take Ethereum to a new era of adoption and new use cases.
