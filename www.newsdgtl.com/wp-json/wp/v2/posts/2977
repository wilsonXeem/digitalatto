One of those is billionaire Warren Buffett who has not been shy to voice his displeasure with the digital asset. This time around, Buffett has once again made known his hatred for the digital asset by saying that he would not buy all of the BTC in the world for $25. This has drawn the ire of investors in the space, one of which is Mexico\u2019s third-richest man, Ricardo Salinas Pliego.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Warren Buffett Disses Bitcoin<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Billionaire and legendary investor Warren Buffett recently made some <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/04\/30\/warren-buffett-gives-his-most-expansive-explanation-for-why-he-doesnt-believe-in-bitcoin.html\">remarks<\/a> about bitcoin. The most popular of these have been the fact that he said that if he were offered all the bitcoins that exist for a measly $25, he still wouldn\u2019t take the deal.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Berkshire Hathaway head said this at the annual shareholder meeting where he once more reiterated his disdain for cryptocurrencies. He explained that bitcoin had nothing to offer, making it an unproductive asset with no tangible production.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/tether-usdt-q1-trading-volume-plunges\/\">Tether (USDT) Q1 Trading Volume Plunges To $5.3 Trillion In Quarterly Low<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He compared the digital asset to other stores of value which include land and apartments. Both of these, the billionaire admitted he would jump at a chance to put money into them. However, he wouldn\u2019t do the same for bitcoin because it doesn\u2019t produce anything and he would \u201chave to sell it back to you one way or another.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Despite the popularity of the digital asset over the years, the billionaire is still not convinced of its valuability. He pointed to the fact that he can\u2019t tell for sure where the asset will be in the next five or 10 years but remains completely sure of the fact it does not produce anything.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cIt\u2019s got a magic to it and people have attached magics to lots of things,\u201d Buffett noted.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Salinas Fires Back<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Buffett\u2019s comments about bitcoin have no doubt stirred up criticism from the bitcoin community. They came out en masse to support and fire back at Buffett after the video made the rounds on social media. Bitcoin supporter and Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego also took time out to rebuke Buffett\u2019s comment.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/ViErLXLv\/\" alt=\"Bitcoin price chart from TradingView.com\" width=\"3278\" height=\"1758\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC holding the $36,000-$38,000 support level | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/TradingView.com\">BTCUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p class=\"p2\">Salinas noted that Buffett was old and immune to change.
