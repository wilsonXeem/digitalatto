Now, DOGE is losing all the gains and dropping hard in a short span of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It seems that the buy pump following the Twitter acquisition of Musk was practically short-lived. Today, DOGE is slipping fast at 9%, according to CoinMarketCap. Currently, the DOGE value is a little above $0.14 per coin which reached its peak yesterday at around $0.1667.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the early months following its launch, DOGE surged and it even peaked at above $0.73 in May 2021. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since then, Dogecoin has had difficulty gaining traction despite being perpetually linked to the self-acclaimed \u201cDogefather\u201d Musk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His clever memes and tweets stir more attention for dog-inspired meme coins.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/Mxkg5olk\/\" width=\"1834\" height=\"875\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">DOGE total market cap at $18.10 billion on the weekend chart | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2><b>Most Popular Dog-Inspired Meme Coin<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dogecoin was a dog-inspired coin (Shiba Inu dog in particular) created as a joke. It was swiftly created in a matter of three hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After its creation, Musk was very open about his support to DOGE (and other digital tokens), being what he calls as the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">people\u2019s crypto.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His snaps at Twitter directly impacts DOGE price. The centibillionaire\u2019s influence on the crypto is definitely beyond hype because he can step on the gas and the brakes and it all just happens like clockwork.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Suggested Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/dogecoin-doge-jumps-30-after-elon-musk-buys-twitter\/\">Dogecoin (DOGE) Jumps 30% After Elon Musk Buys Twitter<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><b>DOGE On Twitter<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A lot of Dogecoin followers expected that Musk buying Twitter will help speed up DOGE\u2019s tempo. It did for like 24 hours but the excitement and interest quickly dissipated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DOGE on Twitter is certainly something to look forward to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Currently, Twitter already allows tipping using Bitcoin and Ethereum. The social media juggernaut also allows customers to use their Ethereum NFTs as profile photos, being a part of their premium subscription.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With the addition of Dogecoin, customers will have more options in payments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Majority of cryptos are down by 3% at the moment. Shiba Inu has even slipped further down at 3% in the last 24 hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu coin is now set at a market value of $0.00002326.
