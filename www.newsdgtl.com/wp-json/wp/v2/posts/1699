In addition, they said that the Shibarium TestNet will be up and running, but not for a while. A public beta will also be released after the TestNet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Nonetheless, the team did not reveal specific information regarding the release date. However, the post says that Shibarium will be the best L2 for the Shiba Inu <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/token-meaning-what-is-a-cryptocurrency-token\/\">token<\/a>. Moreover, this project will make it easy to make low-cost transactions for games.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In addition, the team said that they are working on the second private Alpha TestNet. It will be used to make the tools that end-users need. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-wallet-definition\/\">Wallets<\/a>, block explorers, and token transfer bridges are on the list of tools. Despite this, Unification will send private invitations to trusted testers who will give the team their thoughts on the project.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SHIB Is Being Supported by Whales and Shibarmy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">During the last 24 hours, the prices of Shiba Inu have gone down a little bit. It seems like the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum (ETH)<\/a> whales are taking advantage of the downturn in the price. Statistics of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.whalestats.com\/\">Whalestats<\/a> reveal that in the last 24 hours, people bought a lot of tokens called SHIB. The largest ETH wallet now has about $13 billion worth of Shiba Inu tokens in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As a result of the price drop, the SHIB token saw a 39% increase in its <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/understanding-crypto-trading-volume\/\">trading volume<\/a> in the last 24 hours. There are also a lot of Shibarmy people who are helping the coin grow by burning a lot of it. On the last day, there were just 16 transactions that sent more than 185 million SHIB tokens to a burn wallet. That is not all. In just 4 transactions on Monday alone, more than 245 million Shiba Inu coins were burned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/will-shiba-inu-rally-as-shibarium-launch\/\">Will Shiba Inu Rally as Shibarium&#8217;s TestNet Nears Launch?<\/a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\">Crypto Academy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/will-shiba-inu-rally-as-shibarium-launch\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is expected that the value of Shiba Inu (SHIB) will soar in the second quarter of 2022.
