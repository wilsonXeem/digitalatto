Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen by 3.6% and Cardano (ADA) went down by 6.65%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Suggested Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/ape\/terra-not-alone-in-crimson\/\">LUNA Not Alone In Crimson: APE, AVAX, SOL, SHIB All Lose 20% In Crypto Crash <\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With the Federal Reserve pulling a tight rein on monetary policy, there isn\u2019t a hint of a bullish trend. With the way things are going, many traders are looking for safer crypto assets compared to riskier ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meanwhile, Capo is also keeping a steady eye on STEPN, a move-to-earn app built on the Solana blockchain. Capo says that he is looking at a significantly low trading value of $0.60. Looks like GMT is heading down the basement, as he describes.

The $30,000 support supposedly jarred it. A two-day candle has closed right below it and currently tapping that zone as support. At this point, this spot is still not good for buying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Adding salt to the wound is the miserable turnout in the market value of TerraUSD that is pegged to USD.
