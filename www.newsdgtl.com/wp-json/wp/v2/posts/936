Its worth reaches $2.2B. In addition to acquisitions, 2TM is focusing on lusophone markets. In January, 2TM&#8217;s Mercado Bitcoin bought a Lisbon-based crypto exchange called <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/criptoloja.com\/\">CriptoLoja<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Looking at the structure of 2TM, it has a long list of participants. This list includes <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.meubank.com\/\">Meubank<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mbdigitalassets.com.br\/\">MB Digital Assets<\/a>, CriptoLoja, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bitrust.co.uk\/\">Bitrust<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/theblockchainacademy.com\/\">Blockchain Academy<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mezapro.com.br\/\">MezaPro<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/wuzu.io\/\">Wuzu<\/a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/portaldobitcoin.uol.com.br\/\">Portal do Bitcoin<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is clear that Coinbase&#8217;s worldwide acquisition strategy is working. In addition, it recently bought blockchain-infrastructure platform Bison Trails. This purchase came after the acquisition of an Indian AI firm. This decision was made to boost client support because there was negative feedback from the clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Potential of Brazil for Bitcoin Adoption<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There is a recent report from Coinbase for institutional investors about crypto in Latin America called &#8216;Crypto in Latam&#8217;. In this report, Brazil is mentioned 31 times. On the other hand, Mexico, which is known for a lot of interest in the crypto space, was only mentioned 17 times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moreover, the report states the increased frequency of people who trade directly in crypto. As of August, the local crypto exchange, Mercado Bitcoin, saw seven-fold more transactions than it did last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Following on, Latam expansion is a key part of the group&#8217;s plan. The world&#8217;s second-largest <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-exchange\/\">cryptocurrency exchange<\/a> is also looking for business development managers and executives in Brazil as part of a job hunt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is worth noting that Brazil is a hub for <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin<\/a> adoption. This is no surprise at all. There are more than 10 million Brazilians owning <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a>. Additionally, there is good news for crypto enthusiasts. Rio de Janeiro is set to accept crypto for certain taxes in 2023. As reported, the &#8220;mass adoption&#8221; in Brazil refers to the participation of UFC stars and politicians as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/coinbase-will-purchase-mercado-bitcoin\/\">Coinbase Will Purchase Mercado Bitcoin, a $2.2 Billion Brazilian Unicorn<\/a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\">Crypto Academy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/coinbase-will-purchase-mercado-bitcoin\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of Brazil&#8217;s most popular newspapers, Estad\u00e3o, indicated that Coinbase may buy a $2.2B Brazilian unicorn behind the Mercado Bitcoin firm.
