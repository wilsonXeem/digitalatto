This development defies previous market consensus where investors thought the executive order may be much more hostile. The fact that the price of Bitcoin virtually smashed the psychological barrier of $40K shows that investors feel this is a very promising development.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>It is to be hoped that federal agencies \u2013 and especially the SEC \u2013 will take note of this guidance and act accordingly. For example, investors have long expressed interest in a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US. Its approval by the SEC in the near future now seems much more likely. If that happens we may as well see another explosive leg up in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p><script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n!function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s){if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?\nn.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;\nn.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;\nt.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window,\ndocument,'script','https:\/\/connect.facebook.net\/en_US\/fbevents.js');\n<\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.the-blockchain.com\/2022\/03\/09\/bitcoin-rallies-as-bidens-executive-order-provides-crypto-clarity\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bitcoin rallied 9% to over $42,000 this morning, as key points from Joe Biden\u2019s executive order on crypto were leaked.
