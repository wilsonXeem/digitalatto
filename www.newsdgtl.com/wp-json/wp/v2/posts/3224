Over 15 million ApeCoin (APE) were sent to the three AIPs.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Voting has now closed on a set of three AIPs, all of which have passed: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/VQEtMwsh98\">https:\/\/t.co\/VQEtMwsh98<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This includes proposals on restructuring the ApeCoin forum (AIP-7) as well as staking (AIPs-21&amp;22).<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; ApeCoin (@apecoin) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/apecoin\/status\/1522021010991726592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 5, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The AIP-21 offers a staking method with limits for ApeCoin (APE) and the NFT space of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). It creates an incentive for current and potential ApeCoin (APE) Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC) NFT users to obtain APE during the first year.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, the AIP-21 assures that staked NFTs are marketable and that the expansion of the BAYC ecosystem is not hampered by the confinement of tokens that will be staked.<\/p>\n<p>The AIP-22 recommends a 100% ApeCoin (APE) distribution for staking pools as well as a three-year staking term. It suggests putting 17.5 % of the entire supply of ApeCoin (APE) into a staking pool for three years where ApeCoin (APE) tokens will be distributed in 100 million in year 1, 50 million in year 2, and 25 million in year 3.<\/p>\n<p>The AIP-7 proposes a modification to the ApeCoin (APE) forum&#8217;s structure. The focus is to enhance the proposal procedure as well as the other 3 pillars including governance, education, and community. Furthermore, it offers AIP-related debate, workstreams on DAO work, and the growth and enhancement of the community. All AIPs will be implemented by the ApeCoin DAO in accordance with DAO governance guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>The price of ApeCoin (APE) has risen by approximately 20% in the previous 24 hours.
