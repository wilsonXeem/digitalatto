The size of the investment keeps the undesirables away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Proof Collective is all about NFTs. Because it\u2019s the law, they run a private Discord in which you can probably receive the biggest alpha available. The organization also provides NFT info via its social media, produces <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.proof.xyz\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">a podcast<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in which they interview the biggest names in the NFT world, and, reportedly, owns a huge NFT collection.\u00a0 At least its members do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/collective.proof.xyz\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to the website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, those members own 153K NFTs, including 148 CryptoPunks and 817 Bored Apes.

Besides a social club of sorts, the organization believes in \u201cgroup bottoms-up-driven research.\u201d Plus, some members are early NFT adopters that own all of the projects you hear about on social media and are actively looking for the next one. If you play your cards right and the gods smile in your direction, that\u00a0 Proof Collective NFT might pay for itself in a few months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The organization takes things one step further, though. As \u201ca new media company,\u201d The Proof Collective produces and releases its own NFT masterpieces. Their first product where <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/collective.proof.xyz\/grails\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the Grails<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which mint was solely for the members of the organization and had the slogan, \u201c20 artists. 20 unique pieces of art.
