Fans will be encouraged to create the best team of <strong>MLB player NFT cards<\/strong> as possible, which they can then share and celebrate through a gamified experience. In addition, opportunities to connect with athletes and clubs during live baseball games are also expected to be on offer to the community.<\/p>\n<p>OneTeam, the licensing partner of the MLB Players Association (MLBPA), facilitated the landmark partnership, with its Chief Product Officer Henry Lowenfels having this to say: <i>\u201cWe are proud to have collaborated with visionary partners in Sorare, who have reimagined the fan experience through their NFT-based games. The partnership will bring fans even closer to the extraordinary MLB players they admire, as we explore new forms of gameplay and collection\u201d.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
