The consistent downslide of major market movers have pushed many altcoins near their immediate support and below their nearest resistance levels. Recent market conditions have been quite harsh for investors.<\/p>\n<p>The returns have been questionable. Polkadot (DOT) has witnessed a sharp fall in buying strength owing to the same bearish condition of the market. The coin has been in the limelight in the recent times due to the latest development.<\/p>\n<p>These developments are related to interoperability and features of multi-chain which was announced in the middle of this month. These activities have helped buyers to enter the market. Selling pressure however, continue to outpower buying pressure in the market.<\/p>\n<p>Polkadot now has an ecosystem which is consistently striving to bring new projects through para-chain auctions. It is still uncertain if over the upcoming trading sessions that coin can maintain its price action and touch its immediate resistance mark.<\/p>\n<h2>Polkadot Price Analysis: One Day Chart<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_491090\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-491090\" style=\"width: 1816px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-491090 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/DOTUSD_2022-05-23_00-26-43.png\" alt=\"Polkadot\" width=\"1816\" height=\"792\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-491090\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Polkadot was trading at $10 on the one day chart | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/DOTUSD\/?exchange=KRAKEN\"><strong>Source: DOTUSD on TradingView<\/strong><\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The altcoin was priced at $10 at the time of writing and after several rejections from the $11 level. Nearest support level for the altcoin stood at $8 and a fall beneath that could land DOT near $6.26. Over the last 48 hours, DOT broke below its 10 month long support line.<\/p>\n<p>In the past 24 hours, the coin tried to move northwards but the bulls have tired out. The lack of buyers have caused the bullish action to fizzle out. Trading volume was seen in green which is a sign of positive price action, however, another session dominated by sellers could change that.<\/p>\n<h2>Technical Analysis<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_491091\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-491091\" style=\"width: 1816px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-491091 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/DOTUSD_2022-05-23_00-38-16.png\" alt=\"Polkadot\" width=\"1816\" height=\"792\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-491091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Polkadot registered slight increase in buyers on the one day chart |<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/DOTUSD\/?exchange=KRAKEN\"><strong> Source: DOTUSD on TradingView<\/strong><\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>As mentioned above, Polkadot (DOT) has undergone quite a bit of developments recently and that could have helped the investors gain confidence.
