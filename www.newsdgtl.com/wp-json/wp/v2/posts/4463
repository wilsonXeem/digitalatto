BTC started a fresh decline and there was a sharp move below the $28,500 support zone.<\/p>\n<p>The bears pushed the price below the $28,000 level. The price even tested the $27,500 support and a low is formed near $27,505. However, there was a strong recovery and the price climbed above $28,500.

It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $27,505 swing low to $29,749 high. A clear move above the $29,750 resistance level might start a strong increase. In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise towards the $30,600 resistance zone.<\/p>\n<h2>More Losses in BTC?<\/h2>\n<p>If bitcoin fails to clear the $29,600 resistance zone, it could continue to move down.
