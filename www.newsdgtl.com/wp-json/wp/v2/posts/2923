Every Chainlink oracle network comprises several independent nodes that capture data from many independent data providers and collect the data at one point to deliver it on-chain so that smart contracts can use it \u2013 unlike a monolithic network, being a blockchain. However, it is a framework or infrastructure used to build blockchain-agnostic oracle networks to broaden the capabilities of blockchains and layer-2 protocols simply.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chainlink has a very flexible architecture that enables highly configurable oracle networks that can consist of any selection of node operators and data providers. A flexible framework is the building block that can collect with any block, retrieve data from any API, and connect with existing systems. The flexible design of Chainlink can provide any type of data and computation to the smart contract application that is operating on all the blockchain networks. It uses different network parameters, including update frequency, fee payment amounts, etc. DevOps infrastructure providers, premium data providers, and leading enterprises are the operators of Chainlink nodes. They supply smart contracts and access to cryptographically signed data to guarantee additional security.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chainlink (LINK) Fundamental Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chainlink is a blockchain abstraction layer that allows globally connected smart contracts. It enables the secure interaction of blockchains with events, external data feeds, and payment methods through a decentralized oracle network. Hence, it also provided complex smart contracts with critical off-chain information to let it become the dominant form of digital agreement. It has a large open-source community of data providers, operators, researchers, developers, and many other technical team members. The main focus of this team is to ensure and guarantees decentralized participation to all node operators and users who want to work for the betterment of this network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chainlink provides smart contracts with access to real-world data and off-chain computation to highly flourish the capacities of smart contracts. It maintains security and reliability and ensures inherent to blockchain technology. So, it is an industry-standard oracle network. It also has a proven ready-made solution for integrating pre-built and timely security of millions of smart contracts for decentralized applications. It is also a reliable tamper-proof network that uses decentralization, premium data, trust nodes, and cryptographic proofs for connecting very accurate and available data to any smart contract. The decentralized meta-layer of oracle networks of Chainlink allows smart contracts to uninterruptedly create and use an arrangement of decentralized services that unifies disparate technologies, fastens the development of the decentralized app, and enables cross-chain functionality.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Chainlink Works<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chainlink secures the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/pos-meaning-in-crypto-what-is-proof-of-stake\/\">proof-of-stake (PoS)<\/a> consensus mechanism, as it is an Ethereum-based <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/erc-20-tokens-explained\/\">ERC-20<\/a> token. This system depends on the amount of staked tokens to select node validators, unlike Bitcoin, which utilizes the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus. The aim behind the proof of stake mechanism is the concept of reducing power consumption. This is why it is getting popular due to less electrical energy consumption and easy scalability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Grant Program of Chainlink marks with its secure off-chain computation, community grant program, integration grants, social impact program, and research program. It uses a decentralized network of Keeper nodes for automatic contracts and decreases the risk of centralization and manual interventions. It also rewards its developers as they secure the nide infrastructure, increase the amount of on-chain data, and unite the network with other new systems. The program encourages teams and projects worldwide for technical services from Chainlink. The team behind the program is also working on social and non-profitable programs to increase the development of hybrid smart contracts and make the world economically fair. Their funding specialists and academics conduct and publish unique research to improve the security and performance of the Chainlink Network.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokenomics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LINK token was first launched on September 19, 2017. The price of the token at the presale offering was $0.9. In addition, the participant investors received a bonus of 20%. At a subsequent public sale, the token got sold at $0.11, combined with the presale, dispersed 350 million tokens.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the payments and work are made by LINK token in this network. Link as a payment token pays for the Chainlink node operators to provide them with oracle services. When it acts as a work token, node operators as collateral stakes them for providing oracle services. The staking in LINK is optional, and smart contract creators request oracle services to specify them. If they are unable to provide good oracle services, they lose a node operator\u2019s LINK. The more the contract creators are to use with collateral, the more the LINK will be staked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The subsequent public sale sold LINK at $0.11 per token. Combined, both sales dispersed 350 million LINK. A total of 1 billion LINK tokens were there in initial issuance. Among those, 35% was allocated to each token sales investor, node operator, and ecosystem rewards. The remaining 30% were for SmartContract.com, the parent company of LINK.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In September 2017, at the time of the initial coin offering (ICO), Chainlink had the maximum <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-circulating-supply-and-maximum-supply\/\">supply<\/a> of 1 billion LINK tokens. At that time, the price of Chainlink was $0.11, and a sale of 350 million LINK tokens took place. Therefore, the current circulating supply is 467 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chainlink Future Plans<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chainlink tries to improve the Oracle problem as this inherent limitation of such networks refrain them from connecting to off-chain networks or external data resources. They also want to strengthen a wide range of next-generation use cases and smart contract applications. To achieve this, Chainlink 2.0 works to advance oracle technology in seven main fields, which are as follows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Hybrid smart contracts:<\/strong> They use securely composing on-chain and off-chain computing resources to grow the skills of smart contracts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Scaling:<\/strong> They facilitate the decentralized oracle networks to gain the latencies and throughput for layer-2 solutions, Web2 systems, and high-performance blockchains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Privacy:<\/strong> They are trying to speed up the integration of Blockchain transparency and confidentiality to protect sensitive data and computations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Fairness:<\/strong> They will provide support to sequencing in a transaction fair to users while avoiding ways of value extraction by bots and miners.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Removing complexity:<\/strong> They are trying to provide simple functionality to users and developers so that they do not need to be familiar with the complexity of the protocol and system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Trust-minimization:<\/strong> They will form a trustable layer for support of smart contracts and other oracle-dependant systems through decentralization, guardrails, and cryptographic guarantees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Crypto economic security:<\/strong> They will make sure to have strong economic incentives by nodes to help them behave well even in worse situations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chainlink price is currently $11.
