Their new metaverse-inspired project, Otherside sold plots of virtual land to a roaring crowd of people yelling \u201cShut up and take my money!\u201d In this case, the currency in question was <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/apecoin-ape-is-now-the-biggest-metaverse-token\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the recently created ApeCoin<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. However, since Ethereum hosts ApeCoin and the land NFTs, the roaring crowd needed ETH to pay for the operations\u2019 gas fees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you\u2019re familiar with Ethereum, you already know what happened. According to IntoTheBlock\u2019s <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LucasOutumuro\/status\/1521164297166274561\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lucas Outumuro<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, \u201cThe Bored Ape\u2019s Otherside land sale led to more fees being processed by Ethereum in three hours than in the previous two weeks.\u201d Of course, all hell broke loose. The gas prices across the network went through the roof, many transactions failed causing people to lose their gas fees, and others just couldn\u2019t afford to mint the NFT lands they were entitled to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the end of the day, the Otherside virtual plots NFTs, known as Otherdeeds, sold out. The Ethereum network pocketed around $125M just in gas fees. It didn\u2019t survive the madness unscathed, though. Several Ethereum-based projects reported failed and\/or slowed down operations and Etherscan, Ethereum\u2019s block explorer, completely crashed. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for turning off the lights on Ethereum for a while,\u201d Bored Ape\u2019s creators Yuga Labs stated.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Origins Of Otherside<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Back in March, Yuga Labs raised an Andreessen Horowitz-led funding round of $450M to build Otherside. Apparently, it\u2019s a Metaverse project in the vein of Decentraland and The Sandbox, but with a Play-To-Earn element built into it from the beginning. That same month, they created the now-defunct <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/somethingisbrewing.xyz\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">http:\/\/somethingisbrewing.xyz\/<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to ask people to KYC themselves and link their personal info to their Ethereum addresses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Those registered addresses had the right to mint two plots of land in the Otherside playground. Bored Ape\u2019s holders received two free plots each. There are a total of 55K Otherdeeds. To mint each one cost 305 ApeCoin, plus the Ethereum network\u2019s gas fees. Even though it was expensive, considering Yuga Lab\u2019s successful track record, it seemed like a steal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Until the gas prices rose to unpayable levels, that is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-489538 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/ETHUSD_2022-05-03_04-37-50-460x256.png\" alt=\"ETHUSD price chart - TradingView\" width=\"460\" height=\"256\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">ETH price chart on FTX | Source: ETH\/USD on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/ETHUSD\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bored Ape\u2019s Creators Yuga Labs Speak<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After selling everything, breaking everything, and leaving humble collectors land-less, the Bored Ape\u2019s creators responded to the controversy with this brief Twitter thread.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We know that the Otherdeed mint was unprecedented in its size as a high-demand NFT collection, and that would bring with it unique challenges.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yugalabs\/status\/1520612358825017345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 1, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Among other things, Yuga Labs stated:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even though they took the mentioned KYC measures, too many people wanted in. \u201cThis has been the largest NFT mint in history by several multiples, and yet the gas used during the mint shows that demand far exceeded anyone\u2019s wildest expectations.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Soon, ApeCoin will cease to be an Ethereum token and will become a full-fledged cryptocurrency. \u201cIt seems abundantly clear that ApeCoin will need to migrate to its own chain in order to properly scale. \u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We&#8217;re sorry for turning off the lights on Ethereum for a while.

They can still get them in the secondary market at a premium, but the community is not pleased.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bored Ape\u2019s Users Speak<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What follows is a narrow selection of opinions about the launch. Most of these people are Bored Ape\u2019s rich and are heavily invested in the Yuga Labs ecosystem, but they\u2019re worried. Let\u2019s summarize what they said.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to Ap3father, \u201cThe drop went unbelievably poorly. That\u2019s the truth of it all.\u201d Plus, \u201cthis drop did nothing to help further the distribution of the already popular Yuga community \u2026 the same 27.5k people bought ..\u201d However, he reflects, \u201cYuga Labs made me a millionaire. I am beyond spoiled, humbled, and blessed to be in this situation because of them.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The drop went unbelievably poorly. That&#8217;s the truth of it all. The initial thesis was that not enough KYC wallets exist for it to sell out in wave-1 .. not only was that incorrect \u2026 It sold out with 2+E in gas the entire way \u2026 a nightmare scenario \u2026<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 ap3father.eth (@ap3father) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ap3father\/status\/1520777896268337152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 1, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His conclusion is that \u201cThe community responded atrociously to this mint.\u201d And his advice is to sell, \u201cYou may have millions in NFTs and that\u2019s outstanding, but grab onto reality. When you die one day \u2026 they don\u2019t bury you in the metaverse my friend. \u201d He has extra Bored Apes, though, so he\u2019s not going anywhere. \u201cI am excited to both sell some apes &amp; continue my journey into the otherside.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For his part, Irish expressed suspicion. \u201cHow does the biggest innovators in the space not forsee a gas war? You literally have every address, identification of every KYC\u2019d.\u00a0 Offer each KYCd 2 lands?\u201d And tried to get Yuga Labs to honor their promise to sell him an Otherdeed, \u201cWe hear how you \u201cmake good\u201d I\u2019m thrilled you are paying failed transactions! Acknowledge your mint mistake.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I spent 3 hours constantly refreshing and trying like many here. If you really want to spread to wallets let those KYC&#8217;d mint. We should&#8217;ve been given 2 weeks. And put on allowed mint list on contract. Similarly like Gary Vee did, Instead you chose PR nightmare.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Irish (@Irishmikeys) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Irishmikeys\/status\/1521075162455629831?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 2, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On the other hand, 3433 defended Yuga Labs. \u201cYuga let us mint BAYC for 0.08, they gave us Dogs to claim currently worth 9 ETH, they gave us free serums worth 57 ETH to drink or hold\/sell which made Mutants, worth 30 ETH, they gave us 100-200k USD worth of $APE coin.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sure, maybe the mint could of gone better, we could of had a Cue\/Raffle system, but at the end of the day every successful mint on ETH is a fucking shitshow, we all know this.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 3433.eth \ud83c\udf4c \u2615\ufe0f (@boredape3433) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/boredape3433\/status\/1520789442646085633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 1, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vitalik Buterin Speaks<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Last but not least, Ethereum\u2019s creator Vitalik Buterin defended the Yuga Labs smart contract that governed the whole operation. \u201cRegardless of contract details, tx fee goes up until list price + tx fee = market price.
