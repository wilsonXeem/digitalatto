SolidProof\u2019s team accurately provides audit reports on time and transparently.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, SolidProof can examine quite complicated smart contracts thanks to its automated audits. Anyone familiar with smart contracts will quickly understand how challenging it can be to audit every one of them manually, which is why this feature attracts the market\u2019s interest.<\/p>\n<p>After the automatic review, SolidProof auditors deliver an audit report to the project development team. The severity of vulnerabilities is evaluated in this deliverable using three levels: critical, medium, and low.<\/p>\n<p>The auditors then provide suggestions for resolving any remaining issues or inefficiencies in the system. They work with the project\u2019s backers to resolve any flaws that have been discovered. In the end, the team produces the final audit report and a certificate proving that the project is safe for widespread usage.<\/p>\n<p>As mentioned, the plan is for SolidProof\u2019s new tool at the end of the current month, promising to have an essential service for blockchain projects to detect hard-to-find. The system will play a key role in boosting DeFi projects\u2019 safety and building trust with their customers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other Developments at SolidProof<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To understand the success of SolidProof, one can find it helpful to look at the project \u201clive tracker\u201d feature that the audit company introduced in November 2021. This counter shows over 500 projects in SolidProof\u2019s ecosystem, indicating that the group has knowledge that goes beyond 1,000 crypto projects.<\/p>\n<p>Among the teams that decided to trust SolidProof include Cult DAO, UniCrypt, Kryxivia, and Arker.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, SolidProof announced it will expand its business in the Asian market. The team wishes to introduce several tools to overcome language obstacles and raise the level of verification for Asian professionals and documents providing KYC services.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"mashsb-container mashsb-main mashsb-stretched\">\n                <\/aside>\n<p>            <!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.8.1-->\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/p><\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptoninjas.net\/2022\/04\/07\/solidproof-to-make-its-automated-blockchain-audit-tool-freely-available\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After introducing the SolidProof Automated Auto Tool (SAAT), German blockchain audit company SolidProof will now make the product available on a large scale.
