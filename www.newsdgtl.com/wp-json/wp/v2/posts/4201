As this <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nftplazas.com\/nft-market-analysis-nft-artist-foundation\/\">guide<\/a> to being a successful NFT artist on Foundation showcases, this rings true through the fact its individual sales figures were generally a function of the illustriousness of an artist\u2019s social circle on the platform.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For now, Foundation is keeping its cards close to its chest with regards to why it\u2019s decided to <strong>democratize the ability to list NFTs<\/strong> on the platform, however, the disappointing <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/andrevieiraart\/status\/1527238764048826368\/photo\/1\">sales figures<\/a>\u00a0which followed the questionable update of its user interface at the start of the month suggests that it may simply be a ploy to boost trade activity.<\/p>\n<p>Although slightly counter-intuitive at first glance, Foundation\u2019s initial invite-only policy was also part of its creator-first ethos. Here, platform creators would receive 85% of the final sale price of their auctioned NFTs, as well as 10% royalty shares on all secondary sales. With many more creators expected to join the platform in wake of its opening-to-all, it will be interesting to see if such proportions remain the same.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
