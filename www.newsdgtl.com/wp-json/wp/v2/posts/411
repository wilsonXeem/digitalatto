Unlike other EVM-based networks out there, Moonbeam is not a direct code fork of Ethereum node software.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, it is a Substrate chain that emulates Ethereum features and its communication protocol to provide a compatible environment. This means that Moonbeam has additional features such as integrated governance, cross-chain integrations, and staking, which are native to Substrate.<\/p>\n<p>DApp developers can deploy on Moonbeam just as they would on other EVM chains, using the exact same tooling and code. Existing major DeFi protocols on Moonbeam include Sushi and Curve, with a number of Moonbeam-native options as well for swapping and lending.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Ambire Wallet enables access to DeFi opportunities from a single interface, which provides a useful central dashboard for users\u2019 DeFi activity.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This includes the ability to swap tokens or access dapps via WalletConnect, with the platform offering a detailed breakdown of balances and past transactions. Ambire also includes scam-proofing mechanisms, for example by ensuring that users give token approvals to the exact contract they meant to interact with.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u201cWallet infrastructure is critical for enabling users to get access to some of the amazing DeFi applications in the Moonbeam ecosystem. The Ambire team\u2019s multichain focus as well as their extensive background in the substrate ecosystem made for a great expansion of our ecosystem.\u201d<\/strong><br \/><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/moonbeam.network\/\"><strong>\u2013 Nate Hamilton, Ecosystem Lead for Moonbeam<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Along with Moonbeam, Ambire also integrated Moonriver, a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptoninjas.net\/2021\/12\/01\/chainlink-oracle-network-integrated-into-smart-contract-platform-moonriver\/\">companion network to Moonbeam<\/a> which provides a permanently incentivized canary network.
