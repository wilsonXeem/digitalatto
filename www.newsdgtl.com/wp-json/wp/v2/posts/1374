For example, the Bombcrypto project token was originally<strong> $0.60<\/strong>, but <strong>eventually grew 60!!!<\/strong> times and reached a market capitalization of<strong> $11,730,000<\/strong>! Or another example of Mobox, which started out at<strong> $29<\/strong> but ended up <strong>growing by 2900!<\/strong> Now the capitalization of the Mobox token has reached <strong>$566,950,000<\/strong>. And there is every chance that IDO \u201cDrunk Robots\u201d will be just as successful. Other examples of the space growth of projects similar to Drunk Robots can be seen in the table.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-487573 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Picture57-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"451\" height=\"226\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>The maximum allocation that you can get on platforms is not big enough for that incredible project. \u201cDrunk Robots\u201d have already partnered with Animoca, and this is a clear signal that the project can raise at least 30x! Before that, NFT-collection of \u201cRebel Bots\u201d also partnered with Animoca and after the announcement, their token rose from $0.2 to $2! \u201cDrunk Robots\u201d has even more potential for growth through collaborations with Animoca, Polygon ZB.com and Binance Smart Chain. And the Liquidifty platform offers some kind of a \u201clife hack\u201d for users on how to participate in the IDO \u201cDrunk Robots\u201d with a larger amount and to get cosmic profit later.<\/p>\n<p>On the Liquidifty platform, you have the opportunity to buy <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/liquidifty.medium.com\/liquidifty-launchpad-conducting-first-nft-airdrop-6ef468ac6d6b\">one of the three passes<\/a> to receive an allocation: Gas, Liquid and Solid passes. This feature is available only for platform users and it gets the pass to all IDOs on Liquidifty.<\/p>\n<p>Given the current number of users and passes, each Solid Pass holder participating in IDO will guarantee to receive a $5,000 allocation! This is a hundred times more than on other platforms and without additional requirements, such as contests or lotteries. It\u2019s a great opportunity to increase allocation and get additional perks like valuable NFTs and access to all Liquidifty IDOs. The \u201cDrunk Robots\u201d IDO is just a few days away, so don\u2019t waste your time and buy Liquidifty passes to be able to get more allocation on the launching IDO.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Liquidifty conducts new events, drops, and contests related to the passes. Last week they did a raffle for solid pass holders with a transparent system from the beginning of the draw to the selection of the winner and the transfer of the prize amount. And the winner got $2000 in my eyes! They make a lot of events and announce them on their <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/liquidifty_ann\/328\">telegram channel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Public round allocation<\/strong>: 25,000,000 $METAL<br \/><strong>IDO and Listing price:<\/strong> $0.01<br \/><strong>FDV on Listing<\/strong>: $27.5M<br \/><strong>TGE MarketCap with liquidity provided<\/strong>: 18,750.000 $METAL\/$187,500<br \/><strong>TGE MarketCap without liquidity<\/strong>: 5,000,000 $METAL\/ $50,000<br \/><strong>Vesting schedule for public round<\/strong>: 10% TGE, 15% monthly<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/company\/allocation-of-ido-drunk-robots-is-only-5000-how-to-get-more-with-unique-passes\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Get ready to be part of the neo-punk city of Los Machines and crush your enemies with your steel fists in the NFT-game \u201cDrunk Robots\u201d on April 7th on Liquidifty, GameFi, and TrustPad.
