About $1 billion went into ApeCoin after Elon Musk made fun of<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bored-apes-price\/\"> Bored Ape Yacht Club<\/a> owners. According to some suggestions, Musk may have \u201caped\u201d into the popular collection while prices are stable.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Elon Musk Makes Fun of a Bored Ape Yacht Club<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After Elon Musk caused confusion in the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-nft-non-fungible-tokens\/\">NFT<\/a> community, ApeCoin went up and then down today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Twitter\u2019s new owner used a picture of several NFTs from the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem as his Twitter avatar. Concerning this action, Musk demonstrated that he still has significant influence over the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a> market today. Within minutes, ApeCoin\u2019s value jumped from $4.13 billion to $4.98 billion, 21.44%. At the time of writing, Musk had an estimated 90,8 million Twitter followers and was still rocking the Bored Ape collage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Following his latest social media posts, rumors began that Musk had \u201caped\u201d into the Bored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s collection. However, these are only speculations, and he has yet to make a buying announcement. Recently, Musk was photographed with members of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.moonpay.com\/\">MoonPay<\/a>. In addition, it is the firm that assisted celebrities like Post Malone and Paris Hilton in purchasing their own Bored Apes. This seems to be the source of those rumors. Despite this, MoonPay purchased the rarest NFT in the collection, Bored Ape #1837, for 569 <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a>, or $1.5 million, after the photo appeared online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As per his Twitter avatar change, Musk tweeted something that made fun of the \u201cBored Ape\u201d community. To use the Bored Apes as an avatar, he just saved the picture and utilized it. \u201cIt looks kind of fungible,\u201d he remarked. Non-fungible assets, such as Bored Apes, are defined as those that have only one owner and are hence not considered \u201cfungible.\u201d Seems like the message was clear from the young entrepreneur to the company.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I dunno \u2026 seems kinda fungible<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1521807738317066240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 4, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">ApeCoin\u2019s Prices Quickly Decline<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After this event, ApeCoin\u2019s gains were shortly lost. Currently, APE is <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/investing-vs-trading-crypto\/\">trading<\/a> at roughly $4.45 billion. For ApeCoin\u2019s four-hour chart, the 200-hour moving average appears to be a place of support. Furthermore, to recover from the 50% drop it suffered over the past week, it must now beat both the 100-hour and 50-hour moving averages. The key resistance levels that must be overcome are $17 and $18 levels. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">On the other hand, a long-term close above this supply barrier could push APE up to $20 or even $23, but only if it lasts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moreover, one must note that if ApeCoin does not hold the 200-hour moving average at $14.30 as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-the-support-zone\/\">support<\/a>, more selling could happen. Breaking this support zone could make traders get out of their positions. Additionally, this could make APE go down even more. Considering these conditions, if there is no other commercial from Musk, prices could fall to $11.50.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/elon-musk-bored-ape-tease-apecoin-volatile\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As of today, Elon Musk affected the price of ApeCoin.
