Morehead noted that within the history of Bitcoin cycles, it\u2019s had six previous bear markets that average about 60%, and 2022\u2019s has been 50%.<\/p>\n<p>In his opinion, the bitcoin cycles will begin to moderate thanks to large institutional engagement, and \u201ca 50% bear market is probably all you\u2019re going to get going forward.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201c<em>I think we\u2019re either at the lows or very close to it.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Morehead said he is \u201cwildly bullish right now\u201d because he believes that Bitcoin and the asset classes will decouple, noting that the high correlation that usually happens during periods of stress \u2013similar to 2022\u2019s turmoil\u2013 eventually breaks, usually after a 72-days average. \u201cI think stocks and bonds may keep going down potentially for years, whereas blockchain assets can go up.\u201c<\/p>\n<p>Morehead accepted that Pantera Capital failed to predict how fear over the Fed\u2019s rates rising would affect the crypto market, but believes that \u201cin this case, the markets have it wrong, and blockchain will decouple from the other asset classes.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201c<em>If you think about it, with rates rising, that is mathematically negative for bonds. It also has a negative impact for anything else with discounted cash flows like equities or real estate, but blockchain\u2019s totally independent of rates.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In his forecast, Morehead expects that six months from now bitcoin will be back to the typical 2.5X yearly growth that it\u2019s been doing for 11 years. If so, then in a year Bitcoin could be worth about $100,000 per coin.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"jeg_post_title\">Scaramucci Sees a $500k Bitcoin<\/h2>\n<p>Similarly, in an <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/joanmuwahed\/status\/1509031516013215749\">interview<\/a> with CNBC, the CEO of Skybridge Capital Anthony Scaramucchi predicted again that \u201cBitcoin will hit $100k in the next two years\u201d based on adoption growth.<\/p>\n<p>Scaramucchi quotes Glassnode claiming that \u201cthere\u2019s probably 245 million wallets out there or accounts related to Bitcoin,\u201d while in October-November of 2020 there were about 85 million wallets. The CEO believes the growing adoption turns into people being more confident in the coin.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cSomebody like Cathie Wood would say to you, a billion wallets, Bitcoin could easily trade to $500,000 a coin.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>While Scaramucchi\u2019s predictions from 2021 were not spot on, he accepts that he failed to anticipate the Russo-Ukrainian war and the elongation of COVID, but he sees no reason for Bitcoin not to hit the $100K mark within two years \u201cgiven the way it\u2019s scaling globally\u201d and its many use cases.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center\"><b><i>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/will-strike-announce-a-partnership-with-apple-at-bitcoin-2022-heres-the-411\/\">Will Strike Announce A Partnership With Apple At Bitcoin 2022?

The Wyckoff market cycle theory is used to predict the market\u2019s direction, and it supports the idea that prices move in a cyclical pattern of four phases: accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown.<\/p>\n<p>These phases can reflect the investors\u2019 behavior, thus possibly predicting future price movement.<\/p>\n<p>Within the Markup phase price action moves in a long uptrend, and the re-accumulation phase is a sideways range that interrupts Markup with small consolidation patterns. After re-accumulation, prices start to move higher, but the support zone needs to hold strongly.

If true and the price continues to replicate the movements, it could retest an ATH.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/i\/hasMZCfJ\/\" width=\"1263\" height=\"613\"\/><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cGlobally,\u00a0<span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"BITSTAMP:BTCUSD\">Bitcoin\u00a0<\/span>is in a larger consolidation channel with a range of $30-67K.
