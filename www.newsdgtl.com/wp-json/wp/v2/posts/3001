He stated that the result of the call was \u201cpromising.\u201d Thus, there have been open lines of communication between the Tesla CEO and the council in the past. Whether the communication is still available is unknown, but Bitcoin investors will be keen to know if and when, Musk will again declare his support of the leading cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n<p>The rationale for exploring whether Tesla will again accept Bitcoin comes from the fact that when they first made the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/02\/08\/tesla-buys-1point5-billion-in-bitcoin.html\">announcement<\/a>, the price of Bitcoin rose over 50% in the following two weeks. Then, just a few months later, Musk took to Twitter to announce that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin due to concerns that mining was too reliant on fossil fuel power.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tesla &amp; Bitcoin <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/YSswJmVZhP\">pic.twitter.com\/YSswJmVZhP<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1392602041025843203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 12, 2021<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Bitcoin\u2019s energy usage<\/h2>\n<p>Several months after the announcement, a Chinese ban on bitcoin mining <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/bitcoin-btc-hashrate-rose-by-over-30-since-july-heres-what-it-means\/\">dropped<\/a> the global hashrate by over 50% and removed many fossil-fueled Bitcoin mines.

Earlier this year, the council stated that <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/46-bitcoin-miners-employ-renewable-energy-sources-to-mine-bitcoin-bmc\/\">just 46%<\/a> of Bitcoin mining used renewable energy. A recent report said that the use of renewable energy by the\u00a0 Bitcoin network,<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201chad increased approximately 59% year-on-year, from Q1 2021 to Q1 2022, making it one of the most sustainable industries globally.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinminingcouncil.com\/\">council<\/a> comprises core members of the Bitcoin mining community, including, Hive, Hut8, Riot, Marathon, Microstrategy, BlockFi, and Argo, to name a few. It can be argued that they have now shown that Bitcoin uses more than 50% renewable energy and that in fact there is a positive trend in this direction.<\/p>\n<p>Your move Elon.<\/p>\n<div class=\"edge-cta hidden\">\n<h2>Get an <span>Edge<\/span> on the Crypto Market \ud83d\udc47<\/h2>\n<p>Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cols\">\n<p> <span class=\"img chart\"\/> <strong>On-chain analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> <span class=\"img price\"\/> <strong>Price snapshots<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> <span class=\"img context\"\/> <strong>More context<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.memberful.com\/checkout?plan=43765\" class=\"btn join\">Join now for $19\/month<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/edge\/\" class=\"btn\">Explore all benefits<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/bitcoin-mining-council-thinks-tesla-may-accept-btc-again-for-this-reason\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Bitcoin Mining Council has released a report that confirms that 58.4% of Bitcoin mining comes from a \u201csustainable electricity mix.\u201d Elon Musk famously said that Tesla would start accepting Bitcoin when \u00a0\u201cthere\u2019s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.\u201d Bitcoin Mining Council [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3002,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[34],"tags":[41,50,45,51,37,44,43,42,40,49,39],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3001"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3001"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3001\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3003,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3001\/revisions\/3003"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3002"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3001"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3001"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3001"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
