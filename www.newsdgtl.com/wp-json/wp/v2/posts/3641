Most notable though had been the movement of the digital asset in the last 24 hours. Ethereum which had been holding up above the $2,000 level had finally succumbed to pressure from bears. This saw it lose about 20% of its value in a day and had effectively pushed it back toward the $1,600 level. The push behind this remains the same; massive sell-offs.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Ethereum Investors Want Out<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Investors in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum, have been rapidly liquidating their holdings in the last week. This has been a long time in the making but no one could have truly anticipated how bloody the market would get. Following the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, the value of Ethereum has plunged significantly but even more interesting is the amount of sell-offs that are causing the digital asset\u2019s price to crash.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-selloff-provides-boost-to-miner-fee-revenues\/\">Bitcoin Selloff Provides Boost To Miner Fee Revenues<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Ethereum\u2019s <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/glassnodealerts\/status\/1524649469400207360?s=20&amp;t=y7twfkZAlpgF_IvZcw8g0A\">exchange inflow<\/a> has now touched a three-month high.

Glassnode reports that ETH daily inflows and outflows currently sit at $1.6 billion each, with a positive net flow of $30.8 million, meaning that inflows remain ahead of outflows.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Elsewhere, traders are taking the same decisions as investors holding the digital asset.
