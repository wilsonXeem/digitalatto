(Bitrates.com)<\/span><\/pre>\n<h2><b>William Hinman: Ether Not a Security<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A judge has granted the request of SEC to file a reply concerning the case against Ripple Lab. The case was ignited by the speech of Hinman, stating that Ethereum is not a security.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Emails recovered as evidence strengthened claims that Hinman had some conflict of interest connected to those comments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2018, Hinman\u2019s speech included this statement:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cBased on my understanding of the present state of ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions.\u201d<\/span><\/h4>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hinman\u2019s speech stated that Ethereum is not a security which insofar is tagged as an opinion based on his own understanding of Ether and the Ethereum Network. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">More so, the decentralized nature, and Ether transactions and sales are not secure, according to his personal knowledge and understanding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On the other hand, Hinman attested that there are four criteria barring the rationale rendered by SEC, stating that said communications made in 2018 won\u2019t fall under the attorney-client privilege.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/J4OfLvvi\/\" width=\"1824\" height=\"812\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">XRP total market cap at $20.60 billion on the weekend chart | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition, communications made by Hinman isn\u2019t confidential information. Further, if in case SEC discovers any other information that can be protected, the only person who can claim that is Hinman.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Ripple Violated Securities Act of 1933?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ripple\u2019s defense on this case is that XRP\u2019s purpose can\u2019t classify the coin as a security. SEC has no power or authority over Ripple considering that XRP\u2019s function is as a medium of exchange.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Further, Ripple states that the currency is utilized as an intermediary intended for remittance and not a security.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Suggested Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/nft\/nft-prices-take-a-beating\/\">NFT Prices Take A Beating After Crypto Market Chaos<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ripple also defended that SEC did not clarify the classification of digital assets which failed to provide Ripple Labs timely guidance or warning as to how the current laws apply to XRP.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, SEC contested that Ripple has in fact obtained advice from them in 2012 identifying its product as an investment which requires SEC regulation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hinman\u2019s speech, however, further strengthens Ripple\u2019s defense as it implied that if Ether or XRP was bought to participate in a decentralized platform and not for earning from trading activity, then it\u2019s definitely not a security.<\/span><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Featured image from CryptoGlobe, chart from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/ripple-xrp-price-picks-up\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ripple (XRP) rallied to $0.439217 Friday from $0.377384 on Thursday in the face of an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission\u00a0lawsuit following the comments of William Hinman, former SEC Corporate Finance director.
