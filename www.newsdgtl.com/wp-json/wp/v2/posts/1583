In regard, Peter Brandt, a veteran trader, tweeted on April 6 about the price prediction based on historical data of Bitcoin. According to Brandt, it looks like people who own BTC will have to wait until 2024 for their next moonshot.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bitcoin Predictions for the Future Months<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Analysts have been surprised by how well Bitcoin has done over the past year. In addition, the blow-off top in Q4 2021 was much lower than expected. Furthermore, people started talking about how the price of Bitcoin changed after BTC\/USD lost more than half of its modest new all-time highs (ATH).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In the past, the market saw a big price rise happen once every four years. This happened after each of Bitcoin&#8217;s block subsidy division events. Meanwhile, today&#8217;s prices are more difficult to forecast due to a wide range of reasons. However, this does not imply that bulls will have their break at a later stage in the present cycle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">According to Brandt&#8217;s statistics. There may not be another Bitcoin surge until May 2024, when the block <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin-halving\/\">halving<\/a> occurs. However, based on historical trends that go beyond halves, this might still result in a 10X price increase. Besides, it is a year too early to be a blow-off top.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moreover, Brand noted that a lot of time has passed since the last two times BTC went up 10X or more. It took an average of 33 months before the next stage of the &#8220;skyrocketing&#8221; began.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Risk Factors Associated With BTC Price<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Analysts believe macro causes are the major factors in keeping Bitcoin&#8217;s price low until the new rocket price hit. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In theory, if the central bank is able to tighten its policies, this might put pressure on risky assets like stocks and bonds. On the other hand, a long period of high inflation and low-interest rates could affect Bitcoin to look bad in the short term.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After the initial shock of these events wears off, the status quo may shift. Both former <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bitmex.com\/\">BitMEX<\/a> CEO Arthur Hayes and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/\">Bloomberg <\/a>analyst Mike McGlone are more <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bearish-bullish-meaning-in-cryptocurrency\/\">bullish<\/a> on Bitcoin in the long term than in the short term.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">According to some statistics, BTC is considered a risk-on. On the other hand, Gold is a secure sanctuary. Correspondingly, this year will be the first serious market test of Bitcoin as a theoretical safe haven. This was predicted by Willy Woo in 2022 February. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As reported, in a war situation, risk-off is the initial market response, followed by safe-havens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/the-next-bitcoin-price-rocket-2024\/\">The Next Bitcoin Price &#8216;Rocket Stage&#8217; May Not Come Until 2024<\/a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\">Crypto Academy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/the-next-bitcoin-price-rocket-2024\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>According to some data, Bitcoin&#8217;s next 10X price surge is predicted to happen in two years.
