The current form of the report does not include the proof of work ban that made its way into an earlier version.<\/p>\n<p>Amendments that would have allowed cryptocurrencies deemed \u2018unsustainable\u2019 were also thrown out last week. This left a version of the report that contained no language that could be construed as attempting to ban coins like Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p>However, if the mandate is thrown out at this stage, it is then sent to the plenary (a session of EU Parliament), where a rejection in April would send the MiCA report back to the plenary in its entirety.<\/p>\n<p>According to Berger, if this happens, the report may be subject to further amendments, which could include a possible proof of work ban led by the S&amp;D and Greens. Therefore, this week is vital to signpost the potential future of crypto and, more specifically, crypto mining in Europe. There is a need for clear definitions between proof of work crypto mining services and services that use proof of work blockchains. Previous versions of the report did not differentiate between the two, meaning that exchanges would have to delist proof of work coins like Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Bitcoin should not be banned<\/h2>\n<p>Personally, the debate about mining efficiency and the sustainability of Bitcoin mining, in particular, is tired. Michael Saylor <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/bitcoin-not-a-commodity-or-security-declares-saylor-as-he-hits-back-at-regulators\/\">recently<\/a> said that \u201cmoney is energy\u201d, which makes a lot of sense. Energy is the one thing in this universe that cannot be created or destroyed, so all trades and transactions must involve energy transfer.<\/p>\n<p>This energy transfer is transparent and linear; you plug in a miner, drawdown electricity, and eventually get a block reward. However, whilst the transparency and direct correlation between energy and proof of work crypto should be heralded for its efficiency, it is instead considered wasteful and unsustainable.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of crypto, no other form of money is as efficient as Bitcoin. You don\u2019t need an office full of workers commuting to work every day. No heating or energy bill is required for any activities not directly related to generating revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin has no supply chain requiring delivery lorries. No inefficient machines are creating toxic waste as a byproduct of the company\u2019s manufacturing process. And you certainly do not need to calculate the carbon footprint of the private jet that the CEO uses to fly across the country for their next board meeting. The equipment used for Bitcoin turns electricity into money in the purest form possible.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, in July last year, Forbes <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/greatspeculations\/2021\/07\/06\/bitcoin-mining-uses-a-higher-mix-of-sustainable-energy-than-any-major-country-or-industry\/?sh=6f29b6bd4cc9\">reported<\/a>\u00a0how\u00a0<strong><em>\u201cBitcoin mining uses a higher mix of sustainable energy than any major country or industry.\u201d<\/em><\/strong> If we talk about regulation and the sustainability of proof of work mining, we should discuss how we can help crypto mining companies convert to 100% renewable energy.<\/p>\n<p>The carrot is mightier than the stick. We should do this, not because crypto mining is wasteful, but because it is not. Using 100% renewable energy to mine crypto is 100% efficient for the monetary system.<\/p>\n<p>If you have any thoughts or insights into either EU crypto regulation or crypto mining in Europe, please reach out via <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/akibablade\">Twitter<\/a> or email.
