On Wednesday, it managed to reach a high since April 11th, above $42,000. But selling pressure rejected the bulls\u2019 advance and failed to confirm the overcoming of this important resistance level. This is crucial for the virtual token par excellence to regain $45,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Naeem Aslam, head of analysis at AvaTrade, warns that \u201ctraders know that Bitcoin has to stay above this critical price level for the\u2019 bulls\u2019 to succeed.\u201d The shortest-term support is now back to $40,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_488604\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-488604\" style=\"width: 597px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-488604\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/BTCUSD_2022-04-21_21-17-25-460x245.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin Price\" width=\"597\" height=\"318\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-488604\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bitcoin trading above $42,000 with a 1.75% increase | Source: BTC\/USD chart from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\">Tradingview.com<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, the expert warned that we should be careful. The IMF is in the spotlight because it says that some countries are using cryptocurrencies to avoid sanctions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Countries like Russia and Iran <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-60870100\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">use cryptocurrency<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to sell their oil and gas.

This is the first time the U.S. Treasury has sanctioned cryptocurrency miners. Bitriver is amid a token pre-sale called BTR.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To curb Russia\u2019s influence on cryptocurrency mining and trade worldwide, the U.S. has imposed new sanctions against BitRiver. The company operates vast server farms that sell virtual currency mining capacity internationally. In addition, this company helps monetize Russian natural resources.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The U.S. Treasury <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/news\/press-releases\/jy0731\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">press release<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> says that Russia has the advantage of energy resources and a cold climate for cryptocurrency mining. However, mining companies rely on imported computer equipment and fiat payments, making them vulnerable to sanctions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The United States aims to make sure that no asset, no matter how complex, the Putin regime can use to reduce the impact of sanctions.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Bitcoin And Altcoins Rising Despite The Risks<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite these risks, the market positively responds and leaves rises for Bitcoin and altcoins.
