Comparatively, the trading volume in February 2022 dropped further to $22.44 billion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The trading price of Dogecoin started at $0.1705 on January 1 and this closed Q1 at $0.1378. That is a nearly 20% drop between DOGE\u2019s opening and closing price in the first quarter. Today, the DOGE price has dropped by 3.1% with a trading volume of $0.13569.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-488961 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/DD-460x336.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"336\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">DOGE is now ranked 11th among the top 20 cryptocurrencies, with a market cap of $18 billion. (Image credit: The Scotsman)<\/pre>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When the Bitcoin price declines (BTC is down at 4.4% today), its peers or other altcoins also suffer a major drop. Call it a domino effect of sorts. Bitcoin along with other crypto tokens are down for quite some time as investors are feeling the agitation with the tightening plans by the U.S. Federal Reserve.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Dogecoin \u2013 The Strongest Meme Coin<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dogecoin was one of the strongest cryptocurrencies last year recording an all-time high and shooting up at $0.7376 in May 2021. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DOGE is on the top 20 cryptocurrencies to date or at the 11<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> spot with a market cap ticking at $18 billion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With the support of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban, Dogecoin is definitely not running out of gas in terms of popularity, market cap, and supply. However, DOGE\u2019s unlimited supply also happens to be its Achilles\u2019 heel because of inflation issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/DRysXSHy\/\" width=\"1834\" height=\"818\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">DOGE total market cap at $20.10 billion on the weekend chart | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The bearish pressure has pressed on the DOGE price putting it way below the critical level or at $0.12. This price behavior happens when it moves fast as it runs on empty. This could trigger a flash crash that could go below the $0.09 level.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>DOGE\u2019s Bullish Reversal<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, this disequilibrium or great disruption can mean one thing. DOGE could be up to a higher reversion. And Musk becoming the new owner of Twitter could turn things around for the most popular meme-inspired coin. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not everyone feels bullish, especially with a meme coin but if it\u2019s a DOGE then you are betting on one of the most robust digital tokens around. With a bullish reversal, people should definitely get ready for DOGE to soar.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Suggested Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin-btc-dips-below-40000\/\">Bitcoin (BTC) Dips Below $40,000 Over Ukraine And Possibility Of Fed Rate Hike<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Featured image from Coingape, chart from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/dogecoin-doge-trading-volume-drops\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With a bearish market, the canine-themed meme coin Dogecoin suffered a major decline in trading volume.
