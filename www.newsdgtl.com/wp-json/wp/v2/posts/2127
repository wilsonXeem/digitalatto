Following its participation in the broader market downturn over the weekend, Terra\u2019s native cryptocurrency LUNA has had the highest 24-hour bounce.<\/p>\n<p>Terra (LUNA) is currently trading 15% higher at $90, with a market valuation of $32 billion. Terra has surpassed Cardano\u2019s ADA to become the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap as a result of this development.<\/p>\n<p>As of this writing, the leading stablecoin is Tether (USDT), which has a market cap of $82 billion. USD Coin (USDC) is ranked second with a market cap of nearly\u00a0$50\u00a0billion.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Suggested Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/terra-luna-outperforms-popular\/\">Terra (LUNA) Outperforms Popular Cryptos Ether, Dogecoin In The Past 24 Hours<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/9Ym1Snph\/\" width=\"1566\" height=\"878\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">LUNA total market cap at $31.10 billion on the daily chart | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p>UST is formed by burning a single terra (LUNA), the Terra network\u2019s original crypto currency.<\/p>\n<p>Other sorts of decentralized stablecoin projects, such as Makerdao\u2019s DAI, rely on an over-collateralization procedure to maintain the token\u2019s peg to the dollar.<\/p>\n<p>The value of Terra\u2019s stablecoin UST has increased exponentially during the last 509 days, or 16 months.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, recent data indicates that UST has been on a stratospheric rise since mid-November, with the market cap jumping by 525 percent.<\/p>\n<h2>Lower Trade Volume<\/h2>\n<p>Despite outperforming BUSD in terms of market capitalization, UST trades at a far lower volume compared to its immediate competition, with Binance\u2019s stablecoin witnessing $2.25\u00a0billion in trading volume over the last 24 hours compared to UST\u2019s $431.78\u00a0million.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, Terra has recently made headlines for its Bitcoin acquisition. The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), its parent organization, has acquired approximately 30,000 BTC to act as a peg and reserve for its UST stablecoin.<\/p>\n<p>But, it has a lot going on behind the scenes. LFG intends to acquire a total of 410 billion dollars\u2019 worth of Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p>However, similar to the broader crypto market in recent months, bullish pronouncements are doing nothing to boost the price of LUNA.<\/p>\n<p>The token\u2019s price has fallen 12.5% in the last 30 days to $77.30, and it has also retreated\u00a034.3\u00a0percent since reaching an all-time high of $119.18 on April 5.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Suggested Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/crypto\/bitcoin-clings-to-40000\/\">Bitcoin Clings To $40K On Easter Sunday As Crypto Seen To Head Lower In The Short Term<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/crypto\/conquering-terrain-terras-stablecoin-ust\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Terra\u2019s US dollar-pegged algorithmic cryptocurrency UST is moving up the ladder and now ranks third in terms of overall market capitalization.
