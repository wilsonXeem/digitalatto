Just 4 days after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine began, the leaks started coming out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/04\/14\/conti-ransomware-leak-shows-group-operates-like-normal-tech-company.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CNBC<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, someone created an anonymous <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/41-4-billion-offering-elon-musk-aims-to-unlock-the-potential-of-twitter\/\">Twitter<\/a> profile and began exposing countless internal group conversations together with pro-Ukrainian sentiments. It appears that the anonymous individual is done, seeing as their last post on Twitter was dated March 30th and contained the following message: <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cmy last words&#8230; See you all after our victory! Glory to Ukraine!\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gihon noted the magnitude of the impact, noting that several of his international peers have spent months looking over the records. According to Cyberint, Check Point, and other experts, the messages demonstrate that Conti functions and is structured similarly to a typical technology firm, with distinct management, finance, and human resource operations, as well as leaders of teams reporting to higher-ups on the management chain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, the mails indicated that Conti maintains real facilities in Russia and could have connections to the Russian government, according to Cyberint. CNBC reached out to the Russian embassy in London for a response but heard nothing back. Previously, Moscow denied involvement in any form of cyberattacks or threats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although this organization has been hacked, Check Point Research believes it will likely resurrect, noting that it is still mostly operational.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/conti-the-russian-ransomware-syndicate-is-harmed-by-leaks-in-the-midst-of-the-ukraine-conflict\/\">Conti, the Russian Ransomware Syndicate is Harmed by Leaks in the Midst of the Ukraine Conflict<\/a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\">Crypto Academy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/conti-the-russian-ransomware-syndicate-is-harmed-by-leaks-in-the-midst-of-the-ukraine-conflict\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CNBC issued a report on threat intelligence companies, Conti, the Russian ransomware syndicate, also considered by the FBI as among the most notorious ransomware groups of last year has incurred some damage from leaks which include their source code of ransomware, as well as the size and other details of their business activities.\u00a0 Conti was [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1994,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[30],"tags":[41,45,37,44,43,42,40,39],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1993"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1993"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1993\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1995,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1993\/revisions\/1995"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1994"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1993"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1993"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1993"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
