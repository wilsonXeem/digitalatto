Let\u2019s take a look at what the article claims, and provide some clarifications and corrections.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Jack\u2019s First Tweet isn\u2019t Worth Millions of Dollars<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This one isn\u2019t very surprising to me, and has been widely reported across the mainstream media. At the peak of the NFT boom in March, 2021, Sina Estavi paid $2.9 million for a NFT version of Twitter Co-Founder Jack Dorsey\u2019s first tweet. Unsurprisingly, at least to me, that tweet didn\u2019t fetch the $50 million he was seeking in an auction on OpenSea that recently ended. The highest offer at press time was <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/assets\/matic\/0x28009881f0ffe85c90725b8b02be55773647c64a\/20\/\">around $30,000<\/a>. Even Mr. Estavi said failure of the auction <strong>wasn\u2019t a sign that the market is deteriorating<\/strong>, but somehow that is seemingly offered up as evidence.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>The number of active wallets in the NFT market fell 88% to about 14,000 last week from a high of 119,000 in November.<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>This is a flat out wrong. NonFungible was the primary data source for this article, and the NonFungible index doesn\u2019t include many blockchains other than Ethereum, there\u2019s many others such as Flow, Solana, or Palm. For example, in <strong>March 2022 NBA Top Shot<\/strong> (on the Flow blockchain) alone had ~38,000 unique buyers and over a million transactions.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the NonFungible data not including many blockchains, this <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/sealaunch\/NFT\">Dune Analytics dashboard<\/a> pretty clearly shows that wallets haven\u2019t dropped anything close to 88%, maybe 10-20% or so since the peak in January\/February of 2022:<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>OpenSea volume is clearly on an uptrend, and has been for a long time:<br \/><\/strong><br \/><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37892 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/OpenSea-Volume-1-1024x376.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"376\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h5><b>The <\/b><span style=\"color: #1d1d1d;\"><b>Time Period<\/b><\/span><b>\u00a0Covered by the NonFungible Report was Q1 2022<\/b><\/h5>\n<p>As you may have heard, this past Saturday alone, Otherside from Yuga Labs sold almost<strong> $300 million in NFTs<\/strong>, which is likely the largest set of NFT sales ever. Even if the rest of the above data doesn\u2019t convince you that the NFT market isn\u2019t collapsing, that sale just a few days ago provides direct evidence to the contrary.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>What Actually is Happening?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>I think we might be headed for a period of consolidation. There\u2019s too many Ethereum collections, and many more continue to launch. The money appears to be flowing to a few high-quality collections. Personally I feel that this is not where the value in the ecosystem is going to be created on a reliable basis.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know exactly where the value will be created, but<strong> broader consumer adoption<\/strong> is not going to come from MetaMask wallets and the like. That\u2019s way too confusing, and filled with hacks and scams, for your general consumer. Stay on the lookout for interesting and unique, high-quality projects!<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
