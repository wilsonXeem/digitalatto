As it grows, new tokens and platforms join the market. Two of the most used platforms currently are <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-dao\/\">decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)<\/a> and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-exchange\/\">decentralized exchanges (DEXs)<\/a>. Through these two types of platforms, the cryptocurrency space becomes even more decentralized. While DAOs are a form of distributing governing power throughout the community of a project, DEXs are slightly different. Through DEXs, everyone can begin selling custom tokens on a specific blockchain without the need to undergo any process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest decentralized exchange on the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-smart-chain-bsc\/\">Binance Smart Chain (BSC)<\/a> is PancakeSwap. Throughout this article, we will tell you where you can buy a token called <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/savanna-svn-price-prediction-2022\/\">Savanna<\/a>. Before we get into that, however, let us take a look at the fundamentals of Savanna.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Savanna (SVN)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what is Savanna? In short terms, Savanna is a BEP20 token that operates on BSC. Because of that, you can buy Savanna only on DEXs native to Binance Smart Chain, and PancakeSwap is one of them. The ticker of Savanna is SVN and you can view its chart on either <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/poocoin.app\/tokens\/0x816cd1e0412943d1d3a1a1fdaee1809879c95e22\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PooCoin <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dextools.io\/app\/bsc\/pair-explorer\/0xb334ec97f320824aa605795e982ec3b7dc4e09ab\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DEXTools<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To make the project more credible, the team of Savanna is public, doxxing themselves a while back. You can find more information on their website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In essence, Savanna is a charity token that wants to introduce Africa to the wonders of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchain<\/a>. Per each transaction, a percentage of the transaction fee goes to the charity wallet which is public. These funds will then be used to donate to charities in Africa. Moreover, the team of Savanna claims that they want to show the world the good side of the crypto community by taking such action.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing in Savanna is as risky as investing in any cryptocurrency in the market, major or not. This is because the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a> market is volatile and unexpected. However, though, Savanna is still in its first stages. This means that it has a long way to go before it actually reaches its full potential. Because it is a low-cap token with potential, maybe investing in it for the long run is not such a bad idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Buy Savanna (SVN)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we elaborate on the exchanges that support Savanna, let us briefly touch on how to buy this <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/token-meaning-what-is-a-cryptocurrency-token\/\">token<\/a>. Well, because Savanna is not listed on any centralized exchange, you must use a decentralized exchange such as PancakeSwap to purchase it. However, though, it is highly impractical to fund a non-custodial wallet directly through a credit\/debit card. Therefore, you should first purchase crypto on a centralized exchange and then send it to your wallet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can buy Savanna using the simple steps shown below:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Create an Exchange Account \u2192 Fund Your Account \u2192 Buy BNB \u2192 Create &amp; Fund MetaMask Wallet \u2192 Connect Wallet \u2192 Buy SVN<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where to Buy Savanna (SVN)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin<\/a> and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a>, Savanna is still very young and does not have the exposure it deserves. This fact is one of the reasons that Savanna is still not listed in any major centralized exchange. However, among other decentralized exchanges, you can find Savanna in one of the biggest decentralized exchanges in the market \u2013 PancakeSwap. As a matter of fact, PancakeSwap is the biggest DEX in the Binance Smart Chain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>SVN token address:<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 0x816cd1e0412943d1d3a1a1fdaee1809879c95e22<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PancakeSwap<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned before, you can purchase Savanna in <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/pancakeswap-review-2022\/\">PancakeSwap<\/a>. Currently, PancakeSwap is the biggest decentralized exchange in the Binance Smart Chain. Moreover, it accounts for the most liquidity pools and market pairs in the BSC blockchain. The only issue with using decentralized exchanges is the fact that you must purchase <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-coin-price-prediction-2021\/\">BNB<\/a> through a different method and then send them to a non-custodial wallet. Only then you can use them to purchase the token of your choice. Other than that, PancakeSwap is the most credible DEX in the Smart Chain network as of right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24123\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24123\" style=\"width: 1919px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24123\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Buying Savanna SVN in PancakeSwap\" width=\"800\" height=\"389\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/pncsvn.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24123\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/pncsvn.png\" alt=\"Buying Savanna SVN in PancakeSwap\" width=\"800\" height=\"389\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24123\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Buying Savanna (SVN) in PancakeSwap Using BNB.

Other than the BSC, MDEX also supports blockchains such as Ethereum and Heco. Similar to other DEXs, you must first import SVN in the exchange in order to swap it. All you need to import the token is its token address which we provided earlier in the article. MDEX is amongst one of the most credible DEXs as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24124\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24124\" style=\"width: 1898px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24124\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Buying Savanna SVN in MDEX\" width=\"800\" height=\"393\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/mdexsvn.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24124\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/mdexsvn.png\" alt=\"Buying Savanna SVN in MDEX\" width=\"800\" height=\"393\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24124\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Buying Savanna (SVN) in MDEX Using BNB.

The SafeMoon Swap is yet another decentralized exchange on BSC. When compared to PancakeSwap, they are still very young. However, they have managed to accumulate a large number of users in a very short time. This swap\u2019s design is perfect for their token which many of you have already heard about \u2013 <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/safemoon-price-prediction-2022\/\">SafeMoon<\/a>. To use SafeMoon Swap to purchase SVN, you need to use the SVN token address to import the token. After importing the token, you are all set to buy SVN.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24125\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24125\" style=\"width: 1907px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24125\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Buying Savanna SVN in SafeMoon Swap\" width=\"800\" height=\"386\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/sfmswpsvn.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24125\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/sfmswpsvn.png\" alt=\"Buying Savanna SVN in SafeMoon Swap\" width=\"800\" height=\"386\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24125\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Buying Savanna (SVN) in SafeMoon Swap Using BNB.

This DEX is specifically designed for the Smart Chain network. At the time of writing, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/burgerswap.org\/\">BurgerSwap<\/a> supports <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/metamask-review\/\">MetaMask<\/a>, TrustWallet, MathWallet, TokenPocket, Binance Chain Wallet, WalletConnect, and ONTO Wallet. So, make sure to check the wallet you have your funds on before proceeding to use BurgerSwap. This applies to the other DEX as well. The process of importing the SVN token onto BurgerSwap is the same as in the other DEXs above.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24126\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24126\" style=\"width: 1909px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24126\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Buying Savanna SVN in BurgerSwap\" width=\"800\" height=\"386\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/brgswpsvn.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24126\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/brgswpsvn.png\" alt=\"Buying Savanna SVN in BurgerSwap\" width=\"800\" height=\"386\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24126\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Buying Savanna (SVN) in BurgerSwap Using BNB.
