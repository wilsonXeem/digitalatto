This also means that the bulls must push XRP\u2019s price up to $0.65 before it can create form a bullish trend.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are The Odds?<\/h2>\n<p>Due to the massive decline, one can only expect the XRP token to record a bullish momentum, or bullish mean reversal, temporarily. On the other hand, we can expect it to be short-term, given the present market structure. The technical oscillator\u2019s value shows that the token tested the all-time-low (ATL) in the hourly, daily, and weekly charts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/more-stress-for-el-salvador-as-bitcoin-dips-to-28000\/\">More Stress For El Salvador As Bitcoin Dips To $29,000<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worthy to note that the token\u2019s price is still trading below the 50-day &amp; 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Thus, a rejuvenated buying pressure would force the price to reach the 50-day Exponential Moving Average before testing the psychological $0.50 mark.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, a decline in the bearish momentum would cause the coin to continue in a steady decline or downtrend. Should XRP break below the current session\u2019s low value, it\u2019d test Friday\u2019s low at $0.40.<\/p>\n<h2>Technical Indicators<\/h2>\n<p>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: The MACD trades underneath the midline with steadily growing bullish momentum. Relative Strength Index: The RSI hovers close to the average line, having no stated directional bias.<\/p>\n<h3>A Brief On Ripple?<\/h3>\n<p>Ripple is an innovative crypto project that functions very interestingly as a cryptocurrency and a payment gateway. Created by the Ripple Labs, the Ripple crypto project enables users to facilitate payments, cryptocurrency lending, and other financial platforms. While Ripple enables worldwide payments, the XRP token allows users to swap between cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/exchange-inflows-rock-bitcoin-ethereum-as-market-struggles-to-recover\/\">Exchange Inflows Rock Bitcoin, Ethereum As Market Struggles To Recover<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Notably, Ripple was established in 2012 by Chris Larsen together with Jed McCaleb. Four years after then, the company purchased BitLicense from New York State to increase the integrity of its XRP token.
