More substantial corrections have occurred in Bitcoin\u2019s history than this current one.<\/p>\n<p>Those who have been around long enough to recall previous meltdowns of more than 50% in less than a month can attest that this is just another hiccup. Since Bitcoin\u2019s inception, there have been around seven price corrections, with the price dropping by half. Bitcoin has always bounced back after each of these corrections.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin fell by 83% in a short period of time in April 2013.
