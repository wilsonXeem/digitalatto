A new blockchain-based platform, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/seatlabnft.com\/?utm_source=NewsBTC&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=Placement1\">SeatlabNFT<\/a>, is changing that. For the fans SeatlabNFT aims to revitalize the ticketing industry by moving tickets on-chain, and leveraging growing NFT technology to execute fast, streamlined, and straightforward ticketing transactions. The platform is based on the NEAR blockchain, allowing for cost-efficient and timely transactions \u2013 but the buck doesn\u2019t stop there when it comes to advantages over traditional ticketing providers.<\/p>\n<p>SeatlabNFT is also bringing to market incentives for consumers, free-to-use capabilities for all, and a native platform token that can be utilized for users to reap rewards. Rewards won\u2019t be limited to digital engagement either, as IRL opportunities will keep fans engaged at every touchpoint. Studies show that a majority of GenZ and Millennials value experiences over products, and SeatlabNFT will ensure that fans are engaged through both.<\/p>\n<h3>NFTs With True Utilization<\/h3>\n<p>For NFTs to turn the corner in broader society, they will require shifting from only art and gamification purposes and moving towards replacing traditional tools with a platform that is more efficient, more user-friendly, and more malleable. Fans and consumers are constantly looking for new ways to connect with their favorite artists, engage with their favorite brands and teams, and reap rewards for their fandom. The next corner of fan and brand engagement includes the likes of community awards, event airdrops, and the true acknowledgment and reward of super-fans and ultra-loyal followers.<\/p>\n<p>Ticketing is particularly conducive to innovation that can open new experiences and opportunities, and SeatlabNFT is addressing just that. The platform will offer the support of a secondary market and offer creators and event organizers the capability to have on-chain revenue splits. For event bookers and orchestrators, managing events and post-show audits just got easier \u2013 and for creators, retaining their fair share of revenue just got more transparent. For all stakeholders, ticket legitimacy just got much clearer too, as the underlying blockchain technology can ensure that all tickets are legitimate. This is especially important in an environment where over 10% of tickets are estimated to be fraudulent. In a space where verification of legitimate tickets is often difficult to establish, SeatlabNFT looks to provide unprecedented solutions.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the SeatlabNFT team has direct buy-in from the host blockchain NEAR, as the project has received a grant from the NEAR Foundation, alongside seed investments from a variety of venture capital firms.<\/p>\n<h3>Up Next For SeatlabNFT: IDO<\/h3>\n<p>SeatlabNFT is gearing up for <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/seatlabnft.com\/?utm_source=NewsBTC&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=Placement1\">its IDO later this month<\/a>, which will unveil the platform\u2019s native $SEAT token to the general public for the only time before the team shifts its focus towards traditional cryptocurrency exchange listings.<\/p>\n<p>The token will serve as both an incentivization and utilization tool; users that hold the $SEAT token will be eligible for discounts, staking opportunities, in-person rewards like free events, and much more.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/seatlabnft.com\/?utm_source=NewsBTC&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=Placement1\">Pre-register for the IDO here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Following this month\u2019s IDO, the team at SeatlabNFT is already getting ready for bigger and broader platform development, followed by Beta testing, some initial launch parties to build excitement, and a full-scale launch by Q4 2022.
