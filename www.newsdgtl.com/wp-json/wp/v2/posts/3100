Bitcoinist is an advocate of creative and financial freedom alike.<\/pre>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Among other things, it proposes the worst definition of NFTs ever written:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cNFTs are bitcoin-like digital tokens that act like a certificate of ownership that live on a blockchain.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">No, NFTs are not \u201cbitcoin-like\u201d at all. And the WSJ just forgot about the \u201cnon-fungible\u201d aspect of these unique digital assets. And yes, someone <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/someone-paid-1500-eth-for-jack-dorseys-nft-compares-it-to-the-mona-lisa\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">bought an NFT of Jack Dorsey\u2019s first tweet<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for $2.9M, another person bought a Snoop Dogg endorsed one for $32K. Both tried to auction the digital assets and only got embarrassingly low offers. Based on those two cases, the WSJ implies that the whole NFT market is dead on the water.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">THE DEATH OF NFTs\u2026<\/p>\n<p>One buyer purchased a Snoop Dog curated NFT in early April for about $32,000 worth of the cryptocurrency ether.

However, the numbers they use to prove the NFT market is dead are suspicious as hell.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe sale of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, fell to a daily average of about 19,000 this week, a 92% decline from a peak of about 225,000 in September, according to the data website NonFungible.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The number of active wallets in the NFT market fell 88% to about 14,000 last week from a high of 119,000 in November.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Notice that they don\u2019t link to NonFungible and provide a few low-resolution graphs that the normal eye can\u2019t audit. However, everyone can <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nonfungible.com\/market-tracker\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">go to NonFungible<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The number of sales for May 3rd is 104.465 and that represents $206B. Hardly the signs of a dead NFT market. Granted, the number of sales for April 3rd is approximately 14K, but on May 1st the NFT market moved a whooping $778B in 117K sales.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That\u2019s not it. The WSJ also presents these stats as if they prove its case:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe imbalance between supply and demand is also hurting the NFT market. There are about five NFTs for every buyer, according to data from analytics firm Chainalysis. As of the end of April, there have been 9.2 million NFTs sold, which were bought by 1.8 million people.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Have they even been to OpenSea? There are hundreds of collections. And NFT aficionados own dozens of pieces. Sometimes, hundreds. Sometimes, thousands. And that\u2019s just one platform that serves one blockchain. Five NFTs for every buyer is nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-489672 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/ETHUSD_2022-05-04_11-17-12-460x256.png\" alt=\"ETHUSD price chart for 05\/04\/2022 - TradingView\" width=\"460\" height=\"256\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">ETH price chart for 05\/04\/2022 on Coinbase | Source: ETH\/USD on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/ETHUSD\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Off The Mark Theory<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This might be the most ridiculous part of the article.
