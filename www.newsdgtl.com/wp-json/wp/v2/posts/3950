Even stablecoins pegged to the price of the almighty dollar were completely shaken. A nefarious actor or group of actors strategically attacked the dollar-peg of the UST stablecoin, causing a domino effect of algorithmically driven liquidation of reserve assets that included BTC.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/expanding-triangle-pattern-bitcoin-last-hope\/\">This Expanding Triangle Pattern Could Be The Last Hope For Bitcoin Bulls<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin plunged through support and many altcoins reached a total drawdown of 80 to 90% or more. LUNA, an asset tied to UST, fell all the way to zero. Billions were wiped out from the total crypto market cap. If there was ever a time to be <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/expanding-triangle-pattern-bitcoin-last-hope\/\">doubtful about the future of crypto<\/a>, it might be now.

Comparing the recent crypto selloff with Black Thursday, the weekly RSI has reached even more extreme oversold levels. Meanwhile, the Black Thursday candle recorded a 50% drawdown, and the latest correction by contrast barely produced 30%.<\/p>\n<p>By definition, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.babypips.com\/forexpedia\/divergence\">a hidden bullish divergence<\/a> occurs when an asset\u2019s price sets a higher low, yet the indicator sets a lower low.

The total crypto market cap is also trading within a parallel channel, of which it just touched the bottom of. The upper boundary of the channel is roughly $10 trillion USD.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-bear-market-comparison-time-for-bull-season\/\">Bitcoin Bear Market Comparison Says It Is Almost Time For Bull Season<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While that fact might be <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/expanding-triangle-pattern-bitcoin-last-hope\/\">the hope bulls need right now<\/a>, bears still could have the last laugh.

The remaining low, however, was followed by another 45% plunge to the final bottom. Another 45% drop from here would take the total crypto market cap back to around $600 billion, or below the January 2018 cycle peak.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, risk is still extremely high, but as oversold conditions increase, so does the potential for reward.
