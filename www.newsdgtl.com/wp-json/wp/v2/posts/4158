Generally, most crypto wallets can store NFTs apart from their original use cases of holding crypto assets. With your wallet, you can purchase, sell, or hold both cryptocurrencies and NFTs, a sort of safe haven for all your NFTs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take a look at the most well-known and reliable NFT wallets:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>MetaMask<\/strong><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Trust<\/strong><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>CoinBase<\/strong><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Enjin<\/strong><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><strong><strong>Coinnomi<\/strong><\/strong><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>MetaMask<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Developed by ConsenSys, MetaMask is a crypto wallet that supports the storage and trading of digital assets on the blockchain ecosystem. Far away from being just a desktop browser plugin on web browsers, it has become a mobile wallet for both Andriod and iOS devices since 2020.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It primarily stores digital assets and hosts a series of<strong> decentralized applications<\/strong>\u2013dApps. The MetaMask mobile application comes with an extension that allows users to store their wallet passwords and private keys, which gives users control over their wallets and another layer of security over their private keys. It can be used to store tokens developed on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain like ERC-20 and ERC-721.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERC-20 tokens are fungible tokens that can be exchanged for one another that match their equivalence. There are more than 500,000 ERC-20 tokens, of which some are USDT, BNB, XRP DOGE, and ETH, to mention but a few. <strong>ERC-721 tokens<\/strong> are the non-fungible tokens \u2013NFTs\u2013 special digital assets that are unique and always discerned by their respective unique properties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The MetaMask mobile wallet is user-friendly and easy to navigate, even for a crypto or blockchain first-timer. The NFT wallet can be accessed by just sliding your screen to the left or clicking on the \u201cNFTs\u201d interface on the right-hand side.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In order to stay up to date on market trends, the <strong>MetaMask mobile app<\/strong> comes with a browser that provides access to market trends on crypto\/blockchain-related topics without exiting the app. Furthermore, MetaMask users can also access various dApps, DeFi, games, etc. on the Ethereum blockchain.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Coinbase Wallet<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coinbase is an example of a centralized digital wallet used for storage purposes and trading digital assets\u2013fungible and non-fungible tokens. It is a user-friendly app, although not decentralized. The Coinbase wallet is special when it comes to storage and trading of NFTs because of the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> Seamless transaction:<\/strong> Unlike other wallets that require a wallet address before you can transfer tokens to another user, Coinbase allows users to transfer tokens to another user with just their username.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Coinbase makes<strong> fiat currencies easily accessible<\/strong>, thereby making it easier for newbie NFT users to start trading seamlessly and instantly.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Coinbase <strong>keeps you up to date<\/strong> with its notifications for price alerts and other related transactions.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accessibility of wallets through dApps.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Makes provision for the personal cloud that enables users to back up their seed phrase.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38551 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/wallet1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"725\"  \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Coinbase is an exchange platform, it also has a separate wallet; this means you can either store and trade your assets on the exchange platform or on its decentralized wallet. To access the NFT wallet on Coinbase wallet, all you have to do is just swipe your mobile screen to the right-hand side where you have the \u201ccollectibles\u201d inscription.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Trust wallet<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trust wallet is another kind of <strong>decentralized wallet<\/strong> that stores digital assets and supports the trading of digital assets. Asset trading on Trust wallets includes: sending, receiving, buying, and swapping. Unlike centralized wallets, the Trust wallet has access to dApps, it is user-friendly and does not store the user\u2019s personal information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Trust wallet supports the trading of digital assets, it does not hold or control them; the wallet only makes digital assets accessible to users. It is more like a bridge between users and their preferred assets. It also supports both Android and iOS mobile devices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Trust wallet is one of the best to store NFTs because of its<strong> interoperability<\/strong> between quite a handful of blockchains. The Trust wallet can store and trade NFTs built on Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon. The NFT wallet can be accessed by just sliding to the left or clicking on the \u201cNFTs\u201d inscription on the right-hand side, just next to the \u201cTokens\u201d inscription.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38552 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/wallet2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"780\" height=\"635\"  \/><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Enjin Wallet<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Enjin ecosystem is a gaming platform that incorporates products that enables the development, trading, and monetization of tokens on a blockchain.

The Enjin wallet is an incredible wallet <strong>suitable for storing NFTs<\/strong> and the wallet is exclusive to mobile devices; i.e., the wallet does not support desktop computers or PC.<\/p>\n<p>It is user-friendly and highly secured, being a decentralized wallet; it enables users to store and trade in-game NFTs and other collectibles. It can also be used to mint NFTs, and as such, users can send NFTs via QR codes.<\/p>\n<h4><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38550 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/wallet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"568\"  \/><\/h4>\n<p><strong>Coinomi Wallet<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Coinomi wallet is the oldest multi-chain wallet that supports over 125 blockchain ecosystems and supports multiple cryptocurrencies in this regard.

Right now, the most widely supported NFT wallet across blockchains is Coinomi but with regards to marketplaces, it is MetaMask.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
