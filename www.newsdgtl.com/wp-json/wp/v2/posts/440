Closing pending orders and liquidating in small portions means that users are less likely to find all their collateral has been sold to cover losses.<\/p>\n<p>WOO X\u2019s iOS and Android apps have also been updated to include perps.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u201cZero-fee futures is no longer a pipe dream \u2014 simply stake 1800 WOO on WOO X and lock in zero-fee trading for life.
