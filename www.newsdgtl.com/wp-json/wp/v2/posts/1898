With approximately $100 trillion in assets under management, buying and selling them can hugely impact asset prices. More recently, these powerful financial institutions have developed an interest in cryptocurrencies. According to a study by Fidelity, 52% of institutional investors already own digital assets, and 71% intend to do so in the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-decentralized-finance\/\">Decentralized finance (DeFi)<\/a> is also gaining popularity. By allowing individuals to borrow, lend, and earn interest without the help of banks, DeFi products reduce the cost and increase the efficiency and accessibility of financial services. It\u2019s no surprise that this value proposition has driven rapid adoption, with DeFi investments growing over 1,200% to $253 billion last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given these trends, it makes sense to allocate a portion of your portfolio to cryptocurrencies. Although there are thousands of cryptocurrencies, dozens of them seem like worthwhile investments.

Unlike Bitcoin, DOGE will likely be overtaken in capitalization by utility <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/dogecoin-vs-shiba-inu\/\">memecoins<\/a>. However, it is worth mentioning that Dogecoin\u2019s biggest supporter Elon Musk has just made an offer to purchase 100% of Twitter and make it private. If the deal goes through, it could also have implications for DOGE. Twitter has already been implementing Web 3.0 features in its platform, and with the leadership of Musk, it\u2019s likely that DOGE may play a huge role in that. Hence, even though it seems unlikely for now, DOGE could soar higher in the coming months.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">BREAKING: Elon Musk Launches $43 Billion Hostile Takeover of Twitter <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/FjHzkuFrsJ\">https:\/\/t.co\/FjHzkuFrsJ<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/gDVqnG7pAH\">pic.twitter.com\/gDVqnG7pAH<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Shiv Aroor (@ShivAroor) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ShivAroor\/status\/1514550915251855371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 14, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shiba Inu<\/span><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24541\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24541\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-24541\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Logo. \" width=\"500\" height=\"505\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/2fd57c67bed2b1a47bf86b435c5623bb.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-24541\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/2fd57c67bed2b1a47bf86b435c5623bb.png\" alt=\"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Logo. \" width=\"500\" height=\"505\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24541\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shiba Inu (SHIB) Logo.
