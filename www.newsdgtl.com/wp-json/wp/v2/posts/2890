Garfield is often touted as the <strong>pioneering genius<\/strong> behind the digital trading card game genre.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Rubinelli, CGO of WAX Studios, has since spoken on the rationale behind consulting the expertise of the mathematician-come-game designer: <i>\u201cWe set up WAX Studios because we feel Web3 gaming is in urgent need of redefinition. Right now, it\u2019s more about farming than having fun. Bringing in\u00a0Richard Garfield\u00a0and his beautiful, mathematical, and strategy-driven mind to the creative team behind our new PvP layer will boost Blockchain Brawlers to entirely new levels and raise the bar on Web3 gaming\u201d.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>That being said, the new gaming ecosystem seems to have done rather well even before the announcement of Garfield, as in the two weeks following its <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nftplazas.com\/blockchain-brawlers-wax\/\">launch<\/a> earlier this month,<strong> $BRWL amassed over $431 million<\/strong> worth of trade volume.<\/p>\n<p>In the long run, the core ambition of the game, as well as WAX Studios in general, is to engage as many people as possible with its Web3 offering of head-to-head gameplay dynamics, a concept that has proven ever so successful within other sports and combat-based Web2 titles. To extend beyond these centralized systems, and to add to its P2E mechanics, the studio intends to leverage Web3 even further by developing secondary market opportunities to ensure users have a solid outlet for crafting gameplay items which they own.<\/p>\n<p><b>Follow Blockchain Brawlers &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bc_brawlers\">Twitter<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
