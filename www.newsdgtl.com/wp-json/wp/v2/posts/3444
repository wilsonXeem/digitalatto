In 2021, he led the Singapore IOI team to achieve the best showing in its history, winning 3 gold medals and a silver medal.<\/p>\n<p>The IOI is a competition of significance across the crypto ecosystem, with many leading figures across the industry having participated.<\/p>\n<p>Notably, the early architect of Tezos Arthur Breitman was an IOI contestant who represented France and secured a bronze medal. Other prominent figures in the Tezos ecosystem who have participated in the IOI include the President of France-IOI Mathias Hiron and Nomadic Labs Senior Software Engineer Mehdi Bouaziz. In addition, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was a bronze medalist who competed for Canada.<\/p>\n<p>To boost blockchain literacy amongst students involved with the IOI as well as secondary and tertiary students, TZ APAC will create a blockchain developer curriculum where students will be able to learn directly from TZ APAC team members across hybrid virtual and in-person classes, workshops, hackathons and tutorials based on use cases within the Tezos ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>With education as a key priority within the Tezos ecosystem, the establishment of the Centre for Nurturing Computing Excellence comes on the back of past engagements with other higher education institutions across the region including Kyoto University, Nagoya University, and the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.<\/p>\n<p>Colin Miles, the newly-appointed CEO of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tzapac.com\/\">TZ APAC<\/a> stated: \u201cOver the past year, we\u2019ve seen a great deal of progress across Asia\u2019s blockchain ecosystem in terms of meaningful adoption and TZ APAC has played a significant role in driving this growth \u2014 whether across enterprising projects building on Tezos or pioneering NFT artists looking to enter the digital frontier. In partnering with NUS Computing, we hope to advance a future in which blockchain education isn\u2019t something limited to niche developer communities, but a vital part of computing curriculums across some of the region\u2019s leading universities.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>TZ APAC\u2019s commitment to Singapore is timely considering that investments in the country\u2019s blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem saw a tenfold increase from 2020 to 2021, with 82 deals valued at a combined US$1.48 billion according to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/home.kpmg\/sg\/en\/home\/media\/press-releases\/2022\/02\/kpmg-pulse-of-fintech-h2-21.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/home.kpmg\/sg\/en\/home\/media\/press-releases\/2022\/02\/kpmg-pulse-of-fintech-h2-21.html\">KPMG<\/a>. In line with this, the TZ APAC Tezos Developer Hub was recently launched in the central business district of Singapore.<\/p>\n<p>Along with other community entities, TZ APAC is backed by a ~US$1.2 billion ecosystem war chest stewarded by the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/tezos.com\/\">Tezos Foundation<\/a> to support some of the most promising local and regional projects. Serving as the entity\u2019s new APAC headquarters at City House, the TZ APAC Tezos Developer Hub is a testament to TZ APAC\u2019s long-standing commitment to cultivating blockchain talent in Singapore and across the region.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"mashsb-container mashsb-main mashsb-stretched\">\n                <\/aside>\n<p>            <!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.8.1-->\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/p><\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptoninjas.net\/2022\/05\/10\/tezos-asia-entity-tz-apac-teams-with-nus-computing-to-develop-blockchain-talent\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>TZ APAC, an Asia-based blockchain adoption entity supporting the Tezos ecosystem, today announced a partnership with the National University of Singapore School of Computing (NUS Computing) to set up the Centre for Nurturing Computing Excellence.
