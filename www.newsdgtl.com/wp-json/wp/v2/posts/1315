The benchmark crypto experienced a relief rally into these levels, but bulls have been unable to sustain momentum beyond this period.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_487534\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-487534\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-487534 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSD-860x386.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin BTC BTCUSD\" width=\"860\" height=\"386\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-487534\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">BTC\u2019s price moving sideways on the 4-hour chart.

MI records over $40 million in asks or selling orders. The increase in selling pressure suggest the bears could take over the price action, at least, in the short term.<\/p>\n<p>If the bulls are able to sustain current levels, which seems unlikely due to the above, BTC\u2019s price could squeeze late shorters and make another run into $48,000 and $50,000. However, Bitcoin has been unable to break above these levels.<\/p>\n<p>Since the start of 2022, BTC\u2019s price has been moving in a close range between $35,000 to $48,000. The current relief rally was triggered by more clarity around the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) monetary policy.<\/p>\n<p>The rally has been mainly driven by retail investors, in short timeframes, they have been the only investors class buying into this recent price action. This adds up to the potential bearish thesis as retail lack the firepower to sustain these levels.<\/p>\n<p>As noted by analyst Will Clemente <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WClementeIII\/status\/1511049278667599874?s=20&amp;t=wyLmy4oUY6vD9oSE0YgTtA\">offered<\/a> a different perspective:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is a really interesting chart. Retail (0-1 BTC) is currently buying at the second-highest rate in Bitcoin\u2019s history. \u00a0Looking at retail\u2019s holdings most spikes have coincided with macro tops, but on several occasions, they have bought strategically. This spike is an outlier.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_487533\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-487533\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-487533 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSD-860x484.jpg\" alt=\"Bitcoin BTC BTCUSD\" width=\"860\" height=\"484\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-487533\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: William Clemente via Twitter<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Bitcoin In The Long Term, Retail Buying Marked The Top?<\/h2>\n<p>As mentioned, the U.S. FED decided to begin its tapering process.

In the meantime, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could benefit from a shift in the current financial system.<\/p>\n<p>According to a report from QCP Capital, the global financial system has changed as a result of the confiscation of Russia\u2019s savings.
