Furthermore, gaming guilds will make these projects even more accessible, as scholars play an increasing role of importance in P2E environments. Therefore, one cannot underestimate the potential of gaming guilds.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What Are Gaming Guilds Exactly?<br \/><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The concept of guilds in a gaming environment is not entirely new. Most online games \u2013 either competitive or otherwise \u2013 allow players to band together in a guild. Doing so will enable players to concentrate their efforts and progress further into end-game content, such as dungeons and raids. However, the concept of a gaming guild in a play-to-earn environment is a different creature.<\/p>\n<p>In a P2E environment, gaming guilds revolve around players sharing their existing resources \u2013 in-game NFTs with those who cannot afford the pay-to-play aspect of these games. Most pay-to-earn games require an upfront investment. Some investments are $100 or less, whereas others require four or five-digit commitments. <strong>A gaming guild will enable more players to enter the game without financial obligation.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Players sharing their assets through a gaming guild will often rent them out. The user who receives the in-game asset will then learn to play the game through guidance and share their in-game earnings with the asset\u2019s original owner and gaming guild. The players recruited through this method are known as \u201cscholars,\u201d They need to be educated on the game and its mechanics to unlock better earnings.<\/p>\n<p>The concept of establishing a gaming guild makes play-to-earn projects more accessible. Moreover, it benefits the games through a broader user base, potentially paving the way for a sustainable economy. More players mean more demand for in-game rewards to advance characters, equipment, housing, etc. It can lead to less price pressure on in-game tokens.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Most Notable Gaming Guilds<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Several entities have established themselves as gaming guilds. Either in a specific region or as a global endeavor. Established \u201cbrands\u201d include Yield Guild Games (YGG), Merit Circle, Avocado DAO, UniX Gaming, and Good Games Guild (GGG). Most of these guilds establish a presence across a handful or a dozen blockchain games, enabling more scholars to get in on the action and ensuring broader liquidity for in-game NFTs. Axie Infinity and Splinterlands are two of the more popular games being explored by gaming guilds.<\/p>\n<p>Other projects, like <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bltzr.gg\/\">Balthazar<\/a>, take a different approach to gaming guilds. <strong>The DAO-based approach aims to establish the most scholars<\/strong> \u2013 known as Wizards \u2013 across as many games as possible. Diversifying the approach will lead to more wealth opportunities for gamers, token holders, and investors.<\/p>\n<p>Balthazar\u2019s lending platform lets lenders gift their in-game NFTs and receive an NFT to represent the contract of ownership. In addition, lenders can track earnings through a dashboard and automate delegation, payments, claims, and account creation.<\/p>\n<p>The platform has over 1,500 scholars active already, with over 50,000 waiting to get in on the action. Additionally, Balthazar has a research report division attracting key partners to diversify its approach further.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How Can One Join A Gaming Guild?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Knowing gaming guilds for play-to-earn gaming exist is one thing, but joining one is something else. The easiest way to go about it is by<strong> establishing a direct line of communication with the gaming guild of choice<\/strong>. That involves using social channels like Discord and Telegram and becoming an active part of the community. Most gaming guilds have a waitlist people can sign up for, although it can take a while until everyone\u2019s application has been taken care of.<\/p>\n<p>Taking <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.unixgaming.org\/\">UniX Gaming<\/a> as an example, it is a very successful gaming guild. Evolving from one scholarship to over 7,000 scholars in quick succession confirms a global interest in scholarships for play-to-earn games. Moreover, it demonstrates the gaming guild is very accessible for newcomers, although there are some steps to go through before one can be considered for a scholar position.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The impact of UniX Gaming scholarships cannot be underestimated either<\/strong>. Play-to-earn blockchain gaming can make a strong impact on people\u2019s lives, depending on their situation. Some people enjoy having fun in these games, with monetary rewards being a bonus. For others, the earnings are a lifeline to make ends meet. and UniX Gaming has introduced its own spin on P2E scholarships to stand out from other gaming guilds.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Crucial benefits provided by UniX Gaming include:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>High-quality teams for Scholars to achieve higher in-game rewards and success rates.<\/li>\n<li>Training development and the necessary tools to succeed long-term.<\/li>\n<li>Scholars can become full-time members in the Metaverse.<\/li>\n<li>A professional approach to providing a career to enthusiasts, including health insurance, pension, and other employee benefits. These are game-changing elements for people in developing countries.<\/li>\n<li>Metaverse citizenship with various benefits and advantages.<\/li>\n<li>And more to come.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Play-to-earn gaming guilds have a social responsibility to raise the bar.<\/strong> It is not about making money and earning rewards. There is no need for trade-offs between fun, rewards, social aspects, and career opportunities. UniX aims to combine the best of all elements, setting an example for other gaming guilds to follow.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Gaining More Through Guilds<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>While gaming guilds make play-to-earn gaming more accessible, they also benefit the player in other ways. Scholars can make a fair bit of money from this approach, even if they have to split their earnings with the original NFT owner and the guild. Depending on the game one plays, it is possible to earn <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BalthazarTeam\/status\/1511332989976064002\">up to $50 a day<\/a> by playing play-to-earn games. It is not casual gaming, as it will require hours of dedication and progression.<\/p>\n<p>Those earnings are relatively decent compared to playing solo. More specifically, as a solo player, one needs to make an upfront investment and then work toward recuperating the initial investment. There are no \u201cearnings\u201d until that investment has been recovered, taking anywhere from weeks to several months. It puts much financial strain on players and diminishes the fun one experiences while playing.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, the growth of projects like Balthazar and UniX Gaming confirms <strong>there is a strong interest in scholarships for P2E games.<\/strong> If those gaming guilds can provide the benefits one needs to succeed in game and in life, it may become one of the biggest verticals in the video game industry. The numbers look good for players and earnings, and now is the time to add more professional rewards, benefits, and incentives to the mix.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Benefits Come with Commitment<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It is essential to have the correct expectations for gaming guilds. While it makes play-to-earn games more accessible, <strong>players still need to commit time and effort.<\/strong> There is no free lunch in the cryptocurrency industry, and if players do not meet the gaming guild\u2019s expectations, their scholarships will be revoked fairly soon. If one isn\u2019t willing to commit multiple hours of playtime every day, a gaming guild will not be the best choice.<\/p>\n<p>For players willing to make that commitment, gaming guilds provide many benefits. Not just financially but also in guidance, coaching, and meeting other players who are either scholars or solo players. It is a prominent development for the play-to-earn gaming industry too, as more people get to experience new and exciting games.<\/p>\n<p>Fostering growth will occur through a more professional approach and providing core \u201cemployee benefits\u201d to scholars engaging in play-to-earn gaming. A bright future awaits if that piece of the puzzle can be slotted in properly.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
