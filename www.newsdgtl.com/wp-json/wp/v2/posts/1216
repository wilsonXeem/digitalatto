The cap reached was leveled at the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u20ac1.68M <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">mark, which significantly enhances the capabilities of the project to develop further.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first significant step announced by the team is a complete rebranding, which also implies an update to the company brand vision. Swapin is a reflection of the project\u2019s key mission \u2013 providing access to instant fund transferring (swapping) between crypto and fiat. Regardless of the exact product you choose by Swapin, it will always be aimed at bridging these two common types of assets and the people that use them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Swapin B2C and B2B Product Lineup<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The announced brand philosophy can easily be seen among the Swapin product lineup, which will comprise at least five services by the end of 2022.\u00a0 InstaBuy and InstaFill (relatively similar solutions aimed at making instant crypto-to-fiat payouts accessible) will be complemented with a reliable crypto-purchasing tool (InstaBuy) and several products geared at bridging fiat and cryptocurrencies for businesses and individuals \u2013 CoinCollector and E-com.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The latter two deserve a closer examination, as B2B product development has been outlined as a prior focus for the ongoing year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CoinCollector is a simple but unique online tool that enables businesses to accept payments in crypto and receive the funds directly to their bank accounts without touching or dealing with digital assets. All that\u2019s needed is to create a CoinCollector payment link and share it with a client who wants to pay with crypto. Once the recipient sets the amount that needs to be transferred in fiat, the service provides him a wallet address and exact sum in the crypto of their choice, which will be valid for the next 30 minutes. The only step remaining is completing the transfer, and once that is done, the established amount of euros will hit the merchant\u2019s bank account. CoinCollector fully complies with EU financial regulator requirements as all services by Swapin are supervised by the Estonian Ministry of Financial Affairs and Communications.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E-com, the second option, is a highly compatible payment widget for online shops and merchants designed specifically for entities. Working almost similar to CoinCollector, it can be permanently integrated into any online store, thus significantly broadening its target audience by adding in those clients looking for the opportunity to pay with their crypto. Another positive fact about E-com and CoinCollector is that they protect both businesses as well as their clients from market fluctuations. This means that the client sees the exact amount of crypto he needs to pay, while the entity always gets the demanded sum in fiat currency.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Swapin 2022 Roadmap And More<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This isn\u2019t even an exhaustive list of product updates mentioned in the Swapin 2022 roadmap, as the company seeks to launch a virtual IBAN release option and acquire an EMI (Electronic Money Institution) license by the end of the year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When reached for comment, Evald-Hannes Kree, CEO at Swapin, emphasized the company\u2019s recent achievements:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Swapin is the best possible brand name to reflect our passion \u2013 the endless search for a better way to integrate the worlds of digital assets and traditional finances. We see a large and, more importantly, consistently growing demand from both ends, and we know our clients\u2019 needs. Finally, we have the relevant experience of successfully building products that give us a clear vision of further steps. I have no doubts that Swapin has a bright future ahead, especially with the support provided by our respected investors.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">About Swapin<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.swapin.com\/\">Swapin<\/a> is an EU-licensed, regulated crypto-to-fiat payment processing company.
