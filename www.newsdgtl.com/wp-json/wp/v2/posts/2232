Only <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin<\/a> is worth more. The success of Ethereum can be attributed to its <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/smart-contracts\/\">smart contracts<\/a>. Specifically, developers can use the platform to build and deploy decentralized applications (<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/dapp-meaning-what-are-dapps\/\">dApps<\/a>), software that exists on a peer-to-peer network rather than centralized services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decentralized Finance (<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-decentralized-finance\/\">DeFi<\/a>) products are an example of dApps. They allow investors to lend, trade, and earn interest on crypto without going or paying a traditional bank or broker. DeFi products make financial services more efficient and accessible by removing intermediaries from the equation. Thanks to its first-mover status, Ethereum is the largest dApp and DeFi ecosystem in the blockchain industry. But that popularity has also revealed a significant weakness: it lacks scalability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Ethereum\u2019s transaction volume increased, network traffic speed slowed down. Since each transaction competes for limited mining power, transaction fees have skyrocketed. Of course, an upgrade is on the way to solving this problem, but the scalability should not improve until 2023. In the meantime, other blockchains have already solved this problem and are gaining ground in the crypto market. One of the best examples would be Avalanche.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is why Avalanche could eventually overtake or at least go head-to-head with Ethereum.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High Scalability &amp; Low Costs<\/span><\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">New to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/DeFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DeFi<\/a>?

Its main innovation is the Snowman consensus protocol, a type of proof-of-stake in which validators confirm transactions by randomly sampling a small subset of nodes (computers) rather than exchanging time-consuming messages with all other nodes in the network.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">.<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jerallaire?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jerallaire<\/a> joined Avalanche\u2019s Powering Business with Blockchain series to discuss how major internet businesses and payment portals have already committed to crypto, soon leading to the breaking down of walled gardens and driving mass adoption \u2705 <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/WchB5zcEA4\">pic.twitter.com\/WchB5zcEA4<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Avalanche \ud83d\udd3a (@avalancheavax) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/avalancheavax\/status\/1514700561668476929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 14, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This makes Avalanche very fast. In fact, with a throughput of 4,500 transactions per second (TPS) and a completion time of two seconds, Ava Labs believes Avalanche is now the fastest blockchain in the world. For context, Ethereum runs about 14 TPS, and it takes up to six minutes to finalize transactions. This lack of scalability made the platform expensive; average transaction fees are over $20 on Ethereum, but you\u2019ll probably only pay a few cents on Avalanche.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compatibility<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avalanche is designed to be compatible with Ethereum smart contracts, which means developers can easily transfer their dApps from one blockchain to another. In fact, stablecoin exchange Curve and lending protocol Aave are two of the most popular DeFi platforms on Ethereum, and both went live on Avalanche in October, giving investors a way to access services faster and cheaper.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Thought leader <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/haroldbosse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@haroldbosse<\/a> from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Mastercard?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Mastercard<\/a> joined <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SJohn_Nahas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SJohn_Nahas<\/a> from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/avalabsofficial?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@avalabsofficial<\/a> to discuss the importance of removing barriers to entry in order to achieve <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/DeFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DeFi<\/a> mass market adoption.<\/p>\n<p>Check out the session, streamed live from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/AvalancheSummit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AvalancheSummit<\/a> \u2b07\ufe0f <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/eJFtHnTDZd\">https:\/\/t.co\/eJFtHnTDZd<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/8C0oy8ZEWf\">pic.twitter.com\/8C0oy8ZEWf<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Avalanche \ud83d\udd3a (@avalancheavax) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/avalancheavax\/status\/1514657259955048448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 14, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shortly after, an Ethereum-based stablecoin USDC \u2013 a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar \u2013 was added to Avalanche in December. As the second most popular stablecoin in the crypto market, USDC could energize the Avalanche DeFi ecosystem, as it allows people to invest in DeFi without holding <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-volatility\/\">volatile<\/a> cryptocurrencies. For example, right now, you can earn an annual percentage yield (APY) of 1.56% by lending USDC to the Aave protocol. This is a lot more than the 0.06% paid by the average bank savings account.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These Features Could Accelerate AVAX Adoption<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, Avalanche is fast, cheap, and compatible with Ethereum. Over the past year, this value proposition has fueled rapid adoption. Avalanche\u2019s daily transaction volume crossed 1 million for the first time in January 2022. This represents an increase from just a few hundred transactions per day in January 2021 and is almost equal to the 1.2 million transactions daily averages seen on Ethereum so far this year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Avalanche currently offers 175 <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchain<\/a> projects \u2014 including an array of video games, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-nft-non-fungible-tokens\/\">NFT<\/a> marketplaces, and DeFi protocols \u2014 and ranks second among DeFi ecosystems, with approximately $11 billion invested in blockchain. Going forward, as these dApps and DeFi products attract more developers, consumers, and investors to the platform, the demand for the AVAX crypto could rise, driving up its price. If given enough time, Avalanche could surpass Ethereum in price and popularity in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content proposed by our partner <\/span><\/i><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.miroir-mag.fr\/crypto-avis\/prediction-cette-crypto-monnaie-sous-cotee-sera-elle-le-prochain-ethereum-d15\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miroir Magazine<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More about the author: Almmaye<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alm Maye has been a trader and analyst since 2013.
