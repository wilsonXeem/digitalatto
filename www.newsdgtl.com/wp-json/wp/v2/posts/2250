Still, people in the cryptocurrency industry focus on just one coin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He said;<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tribalism around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is holding back the entire $2 trillion market.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One most prominent example of Bitcoin tribalism is Jack Dorsey, the former Twitter CEO and founder of Square Inc. He has publicly declared support for Bitcoin on several occasions. In addition, he recently sponsored research to foster its development as an asset class to make it more accessible in society.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Earlier this year, Dorsey said that he is a Bitcoin maximalist. As a result, he doesn\u2019t plan on adopting any other cryptocurrency soon, including Ethereum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another example of a Bitcoin tribalist is Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy. He has converted a vast percentage of company reserve cash into Bitcoin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin-bounces-back-past-40000\/\">Bitcoin Bounces Back Past $40,000, But May Struggle To Maintain Position<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The company is a major player in the crypto market, with its holdings totaling over 129,000 Bitcoins.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Garlinhouse said the problem with this maximalism is that it has frustrated efforts to lobby U.S. lawmakers. Most representatives would mainly agitate for the cryptocurrency they own rather than taking an interest in what\u2019s best for everyone else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Garlinghouse added;<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The lack of coordination in Washington, D.C., amongst the crypto industry, I find it to be shocking.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>               Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com<\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/ripple\/the-ceo-of-ripple-says-bitcoin-tribalism-is-holding-back-the-crypto-industry\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As one of the most influential people in the crypto space, the CEO of Ripple says he owns Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
