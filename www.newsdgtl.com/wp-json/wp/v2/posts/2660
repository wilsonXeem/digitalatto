For longer durations, the correlation between the two cryptos and the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 index was 40-50 percent, while for shorter periods, it was about 90 percent.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/nft\/the-top-5-most-valuable-nft-collections-and-a-tool-to-track-them-down\/\">The Top 5 Most Valuable NFT Collections And A Tool To Track Them Down<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Gold and US government bonds, on the other hand, have historically had a negative correlation with stocks.

She added,<\/p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly plausible that Ethereum\u2019s highly anticipated upgrade to a proof-of-stake system could be delayed again given that this transition is highly complicated and still uncertain as to whether it can actually deliver on its promise of lowering costs and increasing transaction speeds.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>On April 11, Ethereum declined 8% from $3,215 to $2,947, the day Ethereum principal developer Tim Beiko announced on Twitter that the June deployment had been postponed as testing proceeded. This month, it has dropped 13% to $2,844.<\/p>\n<p>Following the merger, ETH will function as a quasi-government bond. Stakers will put up money in exchange for a fixed rate of return, similar to a bond principle. This will also cement Bitcoin\u2019s status as a form of digital gold.<\/p>\n<h2>The Merge May Push The Flippening Forward<\/h2>\n<p>Messari has projected that the broader crypto industry would divorce from global markets by 2022. Various segments of the crypto business will continue to gain traction, according to the market research firm.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, predictions that the merger will propel Ethereum over Bitcoin are still circulating. Noelle Acheson, head of market analytics at Genesis Trading, told Reuters that after the merger, more funds will flock to Ethereum.<\/p>\n<p>ETH is currently trading at around $2,850, with a market value of $343.98 billion, while Bitcoin is currently trading at around $38,200, with a market capitalization of $726.69 billion.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/eth\/ethereum-reclaims-3k-3\/\">TA: Ethereum Reclaims $3K, Can The Bulls Clear This Key Hurdle<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<pre>Featured image from Getty Images, chart from TradingView.com<\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/ethereum\/will-the-ethereum-merge-skyrocket-eth\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Ethereum Merge is the most critical aspect of the ETH 2.0 upgrade, since it will convert from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system.
