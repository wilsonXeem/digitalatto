The foremost expert in bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption, Nic Carter, published <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@nic__carter\/noahbjectivity-on-bitcoin-mining-2052226310cb\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">an exhaustive report on mining<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Among other things, it contained hard data that showed to what extent China was mining using hydropower energy. Mainstream media largely ignored it. The party line was that we couldn\u2019t trust China\u2019s statistics. And, that China was probably burning cole.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fast forward to last month. China banned bitcoin mining a while ago and bitcoin\u2019s hashrate relocated, recovered, while the network functioned perfectly throughout. Most of China\u2019s mining industry relocated to green energy-abundant countries. What did the New York Times post? An article called \u201c<\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/02\/25\/climate\/bitcoin-china-energy-pollution.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">China Banished Cryptocurrencies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Now, \u2018Mining\u2019 Is Even Dirtier,\u201d that claims that Chinese miners were using hydropower energy and thus used cleaner energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That\u2019s the level of propaganda we\u2019re dealing with.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What Did The New York Times Say About Bitcoin Mining This Time?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The article starts by featuring Argo Blockchain, the company is building a new facility that \u201cwould be fueled mostly by wind and solar energy.\u201d They even quote Peter Wall, Argo CEO, saying. \u201cThis is Bitcoin mining nirvana. You look off into the distance and you\u2019ve got your renewable power.\u201d What could be wrong with that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Two paragraphs later, the New York Times starts pushing lies and embarrassing numbers:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cA single Bitcoin transaction now requires more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, or enough energy to power the average American household for 73 days, researchers estimate.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course, those ridiculous claims come from Digiconomist, a widely debunked researcher who happens to be an employee of the Dutch Central Bank. And then, they blatantly quote the malicious study mentioned in the intro.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe Bitcoin network\u2019s use of green energy sources also dropped to an average of 25 percent in August 2021 from 42 percent in 2020. (The industry has argued that its average renewable use is closer to 60 percent.) That\u2019s partly a result of China\u2019s crackdown, which cut off a source of cheap hydropower.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And quote Alex de Vries, one of the study\u2019s authors, being completely off the mark. \u201cWhat a miner is going to do if they want to maximize the profit is put their machine wherever it can run the entire day.\u201d WHAT? To maximize profit, a miner is going to find the cheapest source of energy possible. Energy is their biggest cost. The cheapest source possible is energy that\u2019s currently being wasted. That\u2019s the situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-486955 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/BTCUSD_2022-03-26_08-47-01-460x257.png\" alt=\"BTCUSD price chart for 03\/26\/2022 - TradingView\" width=\"460\" height=\"257\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC price chart for 03\/26\/2022 on Forex.com | Source: BTC\/USD on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/BTCUSD\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">More Feel-Good Stories Framed As Bad News<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The New York Times even quotes Paul Prager, TeraWulf CEO, saying \u201cEveryone I talk to now is talking about carbon neutrality. The language has absolutely changed.\u201d And then, the newspaper spreads the good news.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cTeraWulf, has pledged to run cryptocurrency mines using more than 90 percent zero-carbon energy. It has two projects in the works \u2014 a retired coal plant in upstate New York fueled by hydropower, and a nuclear-powered facility in Pennsylvania.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">None of these stories are celebrated. Remember the article\u2019s title, they are cynically presented as PR stunts. Then, it\u00b4s time for Sangha Systems, who \u201crepurposed an old steel mill in the town of Hennepin. Sangha is run by a former lawyer, Spencer Marr, who says he founded the company to promote clean energy. But about half the Hennepin operation\u2019s power comes from fossil fuels.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The New York Times Closes The Loop<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That\u2019s the worst example that the New York Times could find. A person who \u201cfounded the company to promote clean energy\u201d but had to make a compromise to start his business. To close the article, the author brings us back to Argo Blockchain and tries to pull something similar. Apparently, the CEO \u201ccan\u2019t guarantee that Argo\u2019s new center will have no carbon footprint. That would require bypassing the grid and buying energy directly from a renewable power company.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/biden-loves-intels-plan-to-produce-semiconductors-what-about-bitcoin-mining\/\">Biden Loves Intel\u2019s Plan To Produce Semiconductors. What About Bitcoin Mining?<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And then, they quote him again. \u201cA lot of those renewable energy producers are still a little bit skeptical of cryptocurrency. The crypto miners don\u2019t have the credit profiles to sign 10- or 15-year deals.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, Argo is really trying but it\u2019s not possible at the moment for understandable reasons. And the whole industry is moving to a greener path because the incentives are aligned that way. Got it, New York Times. Got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Featured Image by <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\/users\/tacskooo-3660772\/\">tacskooo<\/a> on Pixabay | Charts by <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/\">TradingView<\/a><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/malice-or-ignorance-the-new-york-times-keeps-printing-lies-about-bitcoin-mining\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The New York Times\u2019 campaign against bitcoin rages on.
