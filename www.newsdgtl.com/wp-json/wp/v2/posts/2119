The crypto market is known for providing lots of ways for people to passively earn income. One of the newest ways to passively earn from cryptocurrencies is spending your fiat shopping\u2026 literally. This was made possible by <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/plutus.it\/\">Plutus<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using Plutus, you can literally earn <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a> rewards by shopping with your Visa debit card. But what is Plutus? What is the Pluton token, PLU? How does this project work? Throughout this article, we will answer these and many more questions. Moreover, we will provide a price prediction for Pluton as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Pluton (PLU)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what is Pluton? Well, Pluton is an <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/erc-20-tokens-explained\/\">ERC-20<\/a> token operating on the Ethereum network. According to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\">CoinMarketCap<\/a>, PLU made its debut back in September 2016. It is a reward token, similar to Avios airmiles, given to people who use the Plutus product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plutus is one of the best providers when it comes to distributing crypto cashback through a Visa debit card. Their main product, the card, can be ordered using their website or their mobile app.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Our customers have complete freedom of choice over which Perks they want, and an extensive list of options to choose from!<\/p>\n<p>There are no lock-up requirements.

You can also select various Perks within the app such as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/netflix.com\">Netflix<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/spotify.com\">Spotify<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/amazonprime\">Amazon Prime<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.disneyplus.com\/\">Disney Plus<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.uber.com\/\">Uber<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/apple-one\/\">Apple One<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/deliveroo.co.uk\/\">Deliveroo<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.booking.com\/\">Booking<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aldi.co.uk\/\">Aldi<\/a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tesco.com\/\">Tesco<\/a>; and get up to 100% cashback at these brands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving on, one of the most interesting features that the Plutus platform provides is its decentralized exchange (DEX) known as the PlutusDEX. There, you can swap tokens for fiat.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pluton (PLU) Tokenomics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As stated above, Pluton is the token that Plutus uses. This token\u2019s <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-tokenomics\/\">tokenomics<\/a> were specifically designed for the utility that this token has. According to CoinMarketCap, the maximum supply of Pluton is 20 million, out of which only 1.85 million are in circulation right now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New PLU enters the circulation when people spend with the Plutus Card. This demand comes from users buying PLU to access higher rewards, Perks, and other benefits. According to Plutus, staked PLU is growing at a faster rate than new PLU is entering circulation, which in other words means demand is outgrowing supply. This is a positive indicator that the tokenomics work and the price should rise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of writing, you can find this token on KuCoin, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/coinbase-review\/\">Coinbase<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/huobi-global-exchange-review-2021\/\">Huobi Global<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bitfinex.com\/\">Bitfinex<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.probit.com\/\">ProBit Global<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/hoo.com\">Hoo<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.coinw.com\/\">CoinW<\/a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/hitbtc.com\/\">HitBTC<\/a>. Additionally, this token is currently trading at a price of $7.75 and a market capitalization of $14.4 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crypto Academy Pluton (PLU) Price Prediction<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We at <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/category\/price-prediction\/\"><b>Crypto Academy<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> put research over everything. After doing our own research on Plutus, we managed to come up with a price prediction regarding its token, PLU. Our PLU price forecast mainly uses fundamental analysis but includes bits of technical analysis as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pluton (PLU) Price Prediction 2022<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cryptocurrency market had a very hard start in 2022. The whole market was met with challenges and dips throughout the first quarter of the year. However, it seems that things are slowly getting better and the market is recovering. Considering the global economical and political situation right now, the market is doing just fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe that Pluton has the potential to surpass the $15 mark during the second quarter of the year 2022. Moving on, our forecast shows Pluton potentially trading above the $20 mark throughout the third quarter of the year. By the end of the year 2022, Pluton might set a new yearly high by possibly hitting a trading value of $25. If the market gets as bullish as some expect it to do, this <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/token-meaning-what-is-a-cryptocurrency-token\/\">token<\/a> could even hit the price of $30 by the end of the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pluton (PLU) Price Prediction 2023<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The long-awaited mass adoption of the crypto market has already started. By 2023, this adoption will already be at different levels. This would mean more money flowing into the market, which could lead to higher prices. As for Pluton, we can say the same thing. Our forecast shows that Pluton is likely to maintain a price between $30-$40 throughout the year 2023.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there are many people who believe that the market is going to turn bearish. To further support their argument, there are several indicators that show an upcoming bear run. If this happens, the price of Plutus is expected to fall a bit as well. Yet, our forecast shows that Plutus, unlike some other tokens, will not experience that much of a fall given it has real-world utility and a less speculative following. By the end of 2023, PLU could drop to as low as $20 if the market is bearish.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pluton (PLU) Price Prediction 2024<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2024, the next <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin-halving\/\">Bitcoin halving<\/a> is set to occur. For your information, Bitcoin halving is when the mining rewards of Bitcoin are halved. This happens every four years and often initiates a bull run. If this is the case once again, then Plutus is likely to be affected as well. We believe that Plutus might start a bull run by the end of the year 2024. However, we believe that the market performance of Plutus is likely to be positive throughout the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the market turns bullish after the halving, Plutus might surpass the $50 milestone. By the end of 2024, we believe that Plutus might hit a trading value between $50-$60.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pluton (PLU) Price Prediction 2025<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aftermath of the Bitcoin halving is usually experienced the year after it happens. In 2025, the crypto market is likely to reach unimaginable highs. In this potential bull run, Bitcoin is expected to hit a trading value of at least $500,000. This could spark a new wave of investments into <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/altcoin-definition-what-is-an-altcoin\/\">altcoins<\/a> such as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/dogecoin-price-prediction-2022\/\">Dogecoin<\/a>, and Pluton. Our forecast shows that the year 2025 is likely to be the most bullish upcoming year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, Pluton is likely to set a new all-time high in 2025. Our prediction shows Pluton hitting a price between $150-$200 during the first half of 2025. If the market remains bullish, PLU could end the year 2025 with a price of $220. However, if the market experiences a correction around that time, PLU might be left with a price of $140.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pluton (PLU) Price Prediction 2026<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The year 2026 might not be as lucrative as the previous years. This is because the bigger the market gets, the less <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-volatility\/\">volatile<\/a> it is. However, the bigger the market gets, the more attention it gets. This usually attracts more investors to this space, giving low-cap altcoins the chance to get more investments. We believe that the market will experience smaller price movements in 2026.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Plutus, the same can be said. We believe that PLU is likely to experience a year full of +-20%. By the end of the year, Plutus is likely to be trading at a price of $180.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24852\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24852\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24852\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Pluton (PLU) Price Prediction By Crypto Academy\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-8.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24852\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-8.png\" alt=\"Pluton (PLU) Price Prediction By Crypto Academy\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24852\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Crypto Academy Pluton (PLU) Price Prediction for 2022-2026.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pluton (PLU) Market Prediction<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Price Prediction<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Price Prediction is one of the biggest websites that provides algorithm-based predictions for cryptocurrencies. They also provided a price prediction for Plutus. According to their price prediction for PLU, this token is likely to end the year 2022 with a price over $11.10. Moving on, their forecast shows PLU possibly <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/investing-vs-trading-crypto\/\">trading<\/a> at a price of $16.50 by the end of 2023. As for the year when the Bitcoin halving is set to happen, their forecast shows Pluton with a potential price of $22.29.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the long-term, this platform believes that Pluton is likely to hit the $50 milestone by the end of 2026. Moving on, their prediction shows that PLU could hit a price of $70 by the end of 2027. By the year 2030, Plu might even surpass the $200 milestone. In about 9 years, PLU could be trading at a value of $295.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AJ Five<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AJ Five is an upcoming cryptocurrency Youtuber. In one of his recent videos published back in February 2022, he mentions Pluton and talks about it. During the whole video, AJ Five keeps talking about how great this project is, mentioning its potential several times. He proceeds to inform the audience about the recent price movement of Pluton and how he expects this project to perform in the near future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to his prediction, the Pluton token is looking <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bearish-bullish-meaning-in-cryptocurrency\/\">bullish<\/a> in the long-term, but bearish in the short-term, however, he does not believe that Plutus will experience a dump or anything alike in the upcoming weeks\/months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><noscript><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"PLU PLUTON LOOKS BULLISH, BUY NOW?

We also believe that its supply is crucial when it comes to its price performance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chosen, Pluton is likely going to experience growth during the upcoming weeks.

Unlike many other altcoins, you can find PLU in several centralized exchanges. This makes the project more exposed and has a positive effect on its liquidity. At the time of writing, you can purchase Pluton in several exchanges, including the Coinbase Exchange and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.kucoin.com\/\">KuCoin<\/a>. For our example, we will be using KuCoin.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 1: Create An Exchange Account<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing you should do if you want to invest in Pluton is to create an exchange account. There are several exchanges that support Pluton, with KuCoin being one of the major ones. However, though, KuCoin only allows you to purchase Pluton by using USD Tether (USDT), making the PLU\/USDT the only available market pair in this exchange.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating an account on KuCoin is really easy. All you need is to provide your legal name and email. Of course, you won\u2019t need any private keys since KuCoin is a CEX, but you must set up a password. After creating your account, you can verify yourself through a KYC process.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24849\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24849\" style=\"width: 1920px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-24849 size-full\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"First Step Towards Purchasing PLU on KuCoin\" width=\"800\" height=\"390\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/d1df.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-24849 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/d1df.png\" alt=\"First Step Towards Purchasing PLU on KuCoin\" width=\"800\" height=\"390\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24849\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Signing Up Using KuCoin.

After looking at several market predictions and doing our own research on the project, we have concluded that Pluton might prove to be one of the best investments for you. This is because Pluton is an altcoin with a low <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\">market capitalization<\/a> that provides a real, very useful product.
