The private token sale was led by top investors in the space including Mechanism Capital and Animoca Brands, a blockchain firm that has already invested in over 150 NFT-related companies over the past year.<\/p>\n<p>The funds raised will be used to continue to develop the game, attract top talent, and grow the game community. Furthermore, the funds will be used to create new features in the game including tournaments and high-stakes Blast Royales, planned to be launched later in the year as First Light Games plans a push into esports.<\/p>\n<p>The private sale also welcomed participation from other top crypto investment companies and angel investors including Dragonfly Capital, DeFiance Capital, Play Ventures Future Fund, Double Peak, Polygon, C\u00b2 Ventures, Morningstar Ventures, DWeb3, Merit Circle, Ancient 8, and AvocadoDAO. Nick Chong and Santiago R Santos were the notable angel investors in the round.<\/p>\n<p>The presence of top and influential crypto investors in the company sets the foundation for a successful GameFi ecosystem on Blast Royale,\u00a0 Neil McFarland, CEO of First Light Games shared. With a shared vision, the investors aim to make \u201cBlast Royale one of the best gaming titles (in the blockchain space)\u201d and provide gamers with a \u201ccompelling and fun gameplay that makes Battle Royale game suitable for the Web3 generation,\u201d Neil added.<\/p>\n<p>Developed in 2021, during the NFT and GameFi boom, Blast Royale offers users a platform to battle in a royale survival match. The gameplay involves 30 players entering the fighting grounds in a \u2018last one standing\u2019 competition to win various rewards. Players battle and use their rewards to build up their characters using NFT items won or collected within the game. The players\u2019 meta inventory influences the quality of items carried into a match and the utility of their character.<\/p>\n<p>Blast Royale uses two native tokens, Blast ($BLST), the primary token, and Craft Spice ($CS), the in-game play-and-earn token of the Blast Royale metaverse. The $CS token gives players a wide range of utility within the game including buying enhancing equipment for your character or repairing damaged equipment. Players earn $CS tokens when playing the battle royal matches based on their performance, invested time, and overall effort. The $BLST token is the main token on the Blast Royale marketplace where users can purchase NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>Having invested in over 150 gaming and NFT-related startups, Animoca Brands executive chairman and co-founder, Yat Siu believes Blast Royale will transform the GameFi industry with its \u201chigh quality of gameplay\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cGiven the progress so far and the First Light Games team\u2019s strong pedigree of several iconic hit games, we believe that Blast Royale will be an appealing and compelling metaverse entry for a new generation of gamers,\u201d Siu commented.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In a similar breath, the Principal at Mechanism Capital, Eva Wu reaffirmed the company\u2019s goals of investing in the growing crypto gaming industry.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhen a space like crypto gaming is in its infancy, it\u2019s incredibly important to back strong thinkers who shape how the space evolves,\u201d Eva Wu said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited to work with the team [Blast Royale] to tackle what a play-to-earn world might look like.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>At the end of Q2 2022, the Blast Royale development team is planning on launching a testnet for the game, which, if successful, will usher in the global launch of the game in Q3.
