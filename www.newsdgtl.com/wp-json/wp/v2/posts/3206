Not only must there be many options for active traders and investors, but today there also must be plenty to satisfy the appetite of passive investors who want to put their money to work without doing extra work themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Three platforms stand out as services that offer several ways for <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/the-ascent\/cryptocurrency\/articles\/3-ways-to-earn-passive-crypto-income-in-2022\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">passive investors<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and traders to earn income without having to put in as much time, effort, or even capital to become successful. The platforms are as follows: <\/span><b>PrimeXBT, Gate.io, and eToro<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Passive Income Opportunities Crypto Platform Comparison<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here is a direct comparison between each of these three competitors, along with a conclusion on which of the three reigns supreme.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>PrimeXBT<\/b><\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PrimeXBT is one of the platforms that put passive investing on the map. Once the DeFi trend exploded, it was among the first to make DeFi easy by connecting its platform directly to top industry protocols. By doing so, users are able to stake their idle crypto assets and earn variable APYs of up to 14%, depending on current market conditions. PrimeXBT also offers a way to activate COV token membership that boosts earnings in <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/primexbt.com\/yield?utm_source=PR&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=PrimeXBT+vs.+Gate.io+vs.+eToro%3A+The+Best+Opportunities+For+Traders+And+Passive+Investors\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">yield accounts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> by up to 2x.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The COV token is the native cryptocurrency of the Covesting ecosystem. By activating the memberships mentioned above, users can receive several benefits such as lowered trading fees or increased followings. Covesting copy trading lets skilled users become strategy managers who have their performance tracked within the global Covesting leaderboards. Followers then use this information to find a trader they like, copy their trades, and then sit back and profit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PrimeXBT is a margin trading platform at heart, so strategy managers get access to the professional trading tools provided, such as leverage and long and short positions. There are also more than 100 trading instruments across crypto, forex, commodities, and stock indices. This means that the Covesting copy trading experience can lead to significant profits in a short amount of time. PrimeXBT packs a boat load more features under just one roof.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Gate.io<\/b><\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gate.io is a crypto exchange with a significant focus on buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. However, like many platforms today, they also offer a ton of additional features on top of exchange services. Other services include an NFT marketplace, data analysis, cloud mining, and more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In terms of what is available for users to earn income passively, there are liquidy mining services where users can provision their digital assets as liquidity and receive crypto rewards in return. There is also a single-asset liquidity lending service that provides a decent return on any borrowed assets. Parachain slot auctions also let users earn a decent reward for participation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The meat and potatoes of the Gate.io experience for passive investors \u2013\u2013 like PrimeXBT \u2013\u2013 is more about the copy trading tools. <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/primexbt.com\/covesting?utm_source=PR&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=PrimeXBT+vs.+Gate.io+vs.+eToro%3A+The+Best+Opportunities+For+Traders+And+Passive+Investors\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Copy trading<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is part of what Gate.io refers to as their Smart Quantitative Trading solution. What this boils down to is traders sticking to a specific type of strategy template to provide strict results for users. The end result is a highly confusing system that creates a new copy trading strategy for each copied trader, essentially filling the ecosystem with unworthy duplicates.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>eToro<\/b><\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">eToro is another highly reputable crypto trading platform and <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/primexbt.com\/cryptocurrency-margin-trading?utm_source=PR&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=PrimeXBT+vs.+Gate.io+vs.+eToro%3A+The+Best+Opportunities+For+Traders+And+Passive+Investors\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">cryptocurrency exchange<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that offers a variety of competitive products and services that are on par with the rest of the list. eToro spends ample budget on its marketing efforts, pairing with the likes of Alec Baldwin for US-focused TV commercials.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The platform itself is highly commercialized, which puts added emphasis on the social network aspect of its copy trading offering. The version of copy trading on eToro works much like the other two platforms, where users can find another user based on performance and then copy their trades. However, with eToro, each user can also use the platform as a soapbox, which means there is a lot of noise to filter out. Many like to learn more about the trader they are putting money behind, but a lot of times, these traders leverage their social skills \u2013\u2013 not their trading skills \u2013\u2013 to grow their audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">eToro is also light on other products and services compared to the others on the list. While there is a crypto staking service that provides what they refer to as \u201cgenerous rates,\u201d the lack of clarity around what this generosity is makes the offer questionable at best. Given the rates across the industry, there is no denying that a return on investment is possible, but to what degree?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion: PrimeXBT Provides The Most Profit Opportunities\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this comparative review, we aren\u2019t worried about the active trading tools, referral programs, and other areas of interest for users of these platforms. We are solely focused on comparing the passive interest-generating options available to users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In that regard, PrimeXBT wins hands down due to the simplicity of the Covesting copy trading module compared to other platforms. The convoluted experience of its competitors makes PrimeXBT shine for its ability to design solutions that work for pros and novices alike. Yield accounts offering as much as 14% helps push the platform over the edge as the clear winner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Smart quantitative trading sounds buzzworthy and all, and having <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/elon-musks-comments-about-twitter-dont-square-with-the-social-media-platforms-reality-182023\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">social media<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> feeds integrated into a copy trading experience might seem attractive, but these additions just get in the way of profits. With PrimeXBT, you only have to pay attention to the performance of your portfolio \u2013 and you can do it from anywhere in the world from a free mobile app for Android and iOS devices.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/company\/primexbt-vs-gate-io-vs-etoro-the-best-opportunities-for-traders-and-passive-investors\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the crypto market grows and enjoys broader participation from the global investment community, the products and services offered must be increasingly competitive, easy to use, and more robust by the day.
