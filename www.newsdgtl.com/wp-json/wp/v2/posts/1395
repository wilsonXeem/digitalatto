The Merge will transform ETH into a unique financial asset with commodity, equity, and monetary traits.<\/p>\n<p>Using a discounted cash-flow model on ETH, the analyst concluded that it\u2019s currently undervalued.

During this period, the second crypto by market cap has seen an increase in the price per transaction. This trend suggest acceleration in activity, demand for block space, more adoption, and value aggregated to the network.<\/p>\n<p>Ethereum could maintain this trend well into 2035. At this time, the analyst expects it to reach a \u201cdecay to a terminal growth rate\u201d after a 30% annual rise in transaction fees or cash flow until 2025. This calculations are \u201cconservative, the expert said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/eth\/ethereum-gearing-lift-off-3750\/\">TA: Ethereum Gearing For Another Lift-Off, Why ETH Could Test $3,750<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the long term, ETH could see as much as $9,000 or a 219% increase to the upside. McGlone said the following highlighting ETH potential with the upcoming Merge:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Though any delays or bugs in the Merge could have a negative impact, the main risk to revaluation is sub-par aggregate transaction-fee growth. Once the next phase, Sharding, disaggregates the base chain into 64 individual \u201cshards\u201d, dramatically increasing Layer 1 blockspace, gas prices are expected to fall commensurately. Conversely, this will unlock the full potential of Layer 2 rollups, which can process an increasing number of transactions at almost zero cost.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/ethereum\/why-the-ethereum-merge-could-destroy-eths-competitors\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ethereum could re-test its support zone as the general sentiment in the crypto market hints at further losses.
