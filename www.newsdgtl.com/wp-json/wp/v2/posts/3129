Prices of the coin have looked bearish in the last 24 hours and continued to look negative at press time. In the past week, Dogecoin lost 4.9% because of falling buying strength.<\/p>\n<p>The bulls have stayed out of the charts since the beginning of this month. If the current price action persists, Dogecoin would aim for its nearest support line. Bears have taken control of the market as investors have continued to flee the market.<\/p>\n<p>Compared to last year at the same time, Dogecoin has plummeted by 82% from its all-time high of $0.73. Not just investors, the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s meeting related to hiking interest rates has also kept investors on their toes.<\/p>\n<h2>Dogecoin Price Analysis: Four Hour Chart<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_489700\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-489700\" style=\"width: 1822px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-489700 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/DOGEUSD_2022-05-05_00-10-56.png\" alt=\"Dogecoin\" width=\"1822\" height=\"709\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-489700\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dogecoin was priced at $0.13 on the four-hour chart.

The coin had held prices above the support line of $0.131 quite well because meme-coin barely fell below that price in the past month. Over the past few weeks, Dogecoin has seen relatively choppy price action.<\/p>\n<p>Price recovery for Dogecoin has been brief because right after the coin soared in the last week of the past month, it has been unable to hold onto the price momentum. The meme-coin displayed bearish engulfing candlesticks twice on its charts and every time after that reading, prices have slid.<\/p>\n<p>Sell-off of the asset doesn\u2019t seem unnatural as it is quite a common scenario after bearish engulfing candlesticks. Prices can continue to move lower than their current level. Immediate support for the coin stood at $0.129 and then at $0.118.<\/p>\n<p>Dogecoin last traded near the $0.118 price level in March. On the flip side, the coin could target $0.14 if the bulls come around.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/dogecoin-displays-a-falling-wedge-pattern-heres-what-it-means\/\">Dogecoin Displays A Falling Wedge Pattern; Here\u2019s What It Means<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Technical Analysis<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_489701\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-489701\" style=\"width: 1822px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-489701 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/DOGEUSD_2022-05-05_00-12-06.png\" alt=\"Dogecoin\" width=\"1822\" height=\"709\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-489701\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dogecoin displays a fall in buying strength on the four-hour chart.

It is still quite early to put a finger on that as the indicator could be giving off signals based on the past immediate trading sessions where DOGE tried to recover.<\/p>\n<p>Chaikin Money Flow indicates the capital inflows and capital outflows.
