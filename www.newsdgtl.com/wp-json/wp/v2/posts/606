According to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/coinmetro.com\/blog\/estonia-is-crypto-friendly-true-or-false\/\">Coinmetro, <\/a>Estonia has been ahead of the digital game for many years now. The historic Northern European country, which borders the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Finland, started building its information society about two decades ago. It was named <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/article\/estonia-e-resident\">\u201cthe most advanced digital society in the world\u201d<\/a> by Wired.<\/p>\n<p>Estonia has built an efficient, secure, and transparent ecosystem that saves time, and therefore, money for its citizens. In Estonia 99% of the public services are available online 24\/7. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/e-estonia.com\/\">Estonia\u2019s public e-services<\/a> include: e-Governance, e-Tax, X-Road, Digital ID, i-Voting, public safety, blockchain, e-Health, and e-Residency.<\/p>\n<p>The global\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=ZWxLzge8C8Dl11EiK6Wb6hqbPI-7Taj9BZ_iKvRORVGiZ9qEW0omJa0vEWmyNTDQ87cU31nUBARGjS5_vV4L8PEFxXtr0dUyBBW13DNGxW_2h1K3glDdIsN0QHKt9Il1WrH6H8AZmpXNvScPwVs4MSlbu9sYTSN-GuSQYhLnv5Q=\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data%3DZWxLzge8C8Dl11EiK6Wb6hqbPI-7Taj9BZ_iKvRORVGiZ9qEW0omJa0vEWmyNTDQ87cU31nUBARGjS5_vV4L8PEFxXtr0dUyBBW13DNGxW_2h1K3glDdIsN0QHKt9Il1WrH6H8AZmpXNvScPwVs4MSlbu9sYTSN-GuSQYhLnv5Q%3D&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637900853517000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2D-iGrlhKJLOoj058jaO6b\"><u>cryptocurrency market<\/u><\/a> size is expected to gain momentum by reaching USD 1,902.5 million by 2028. With the use of bitcoins, and other cryptocurrencies, financial instability and economic downfall can be avoided. Therefore, cryptocurrencies are also emerging as strong alternative options in the regions with unstable economical structures, and this has been a major driving factor for the cryptocurrency market growth worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin on-chain analyst <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/woobull.com\/about\/\">Willy Woo <\/a>recently stated that \u201cIn terms of adoption, Bitcoin has roughly the same users as the Internet had in 1997. But Bitcoin\u2019s growing faster. Next 4 years on current path will bring Bitcoin users to 1b people, that\u2019s the equivalent of 2005 for the Internet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Currently, less than 2% of the world uses BTC. Given the current world population of over 7 billion, this is a very small number.
