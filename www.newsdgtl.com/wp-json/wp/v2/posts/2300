With the Armenian-born and Italian-residing artist <strong>Eva Adamian<\/strong> at its creative helm, the collection uses a combination of possible and impossible shapes to demonstrate the limitless artisan qualities of the female body, irrespective of size and shape.<\/p>\n<p>The powerhouse behind the mass feminine celebration is aptly named Impssbl, a world class studio for creating decentralized autonomous stories for NFT projects that create a new generation of fiction led by communities.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Musess NFTs<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>The 999 piece Musess NFT collection fuses the magnificence of human beings with the wonders of modern technology, as 100 of the NFTs will be \u2018Original,\u2019 Adamian hand-draw pieces, whilst the remaining 899 will be sophisticated, AI-imagined parallels of the Originals.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although all of the NFTs will be centred around the wonders of the female body, both types of NFT will have a distinct appeal, as Adamian adopts a Monochrome (black and white) aesthetic for her hand-drawn Originals, whilst the AI-rendered parallels will sport a rich palette of colours and textures.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Irrespective of its type, each Musess NFT will come with a unique story, with the stories of the Originals being written by <strong>a talented group of female writers<\/strong>, whilst the stories of the 899 parallels will be aptly constructed by AI.<\/p>\n<p>To add an extra layer of exclusivity to the 100 Originals NFTs, each will also come with a physical canvas that has been hand-painted by Adamian from her Italian residence (which can be shipped worldwide), which will each count as its own NFT with unique QR code and story.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4><b>Mint<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/b><\/h4>\n<p>The sale of Musess NFTs will be blind, meaning participants will have around a 1\/10 chance of minting an Originals Musess NFT.

It will also grant holders access to UNTLD.XYZ., a platform which creates plots through AI and then allows them to be minted as NFTs.
