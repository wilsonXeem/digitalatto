Although founded over five years ago in 2017, the purchase of Icy Tools serves as the Miami-based company\u2019s first acquisition.<\/p>\n<p>Although many of the acquisition\u2019s details remain undisclosed, it is reported that Icy Tools will keep its platform functionality intact as a fully independent product, with its stand-out GraphQL API to be integrated to the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/QuickNode\">QuickNode<\/a> platform. From here, QuickNode users will gain access to an analytical service which\u2019ll allow them to discover, track and <strong>analyse trending NFTs<\/strong> (across blockchains such as Solana, Ethereum and Polygon, just to name a few), whilst having access to real-time price and volume data, historical charts and transaction histories.<\/p>\n<p>With the addition of Icy Tool\u2019s expertise, which was perhaps aided by the $35 million raided in the company\u2019s Series A funding round last year (which included participation from 776, the investment firm owned by Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian), QuickNode ultimately intends to propel itself to the pinnacle of NFT-integrated dApp development.<\/p>\n<p>This was something alluded to by QuickNode COO <strong>Jackie De La Rosa<\/strong> when speaking on the integration: <i>We\u2019re thrilled about the capabilities that will open up to our customers as a result of this transaction. This is a natural fit for QuickNode because NFT integrations require sophisticated blockchain infrastructure behind the scenes\u201d.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
