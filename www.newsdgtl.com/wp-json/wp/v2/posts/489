Two U.S. officials said on Saturday that Russia is planning to send more battalion tactical groups to the border with its neighbor.<\/p>\n<p>According to a BBC report Russia and ally Belarus have started a 10 day joint military drill now, fueling ongoing fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. The US governement is afraid that these exercises could escalate tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as it could amount to, as the Ukrainians call it themselves, \u201cincreasing psychological pressure.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Russia itself has also denounced the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-60238869\">recent boost of US troups<\/a> within Europe calling it\u00a0a \u201cdestructive\u201d step which heightened tension and reduced the scope for a political solution.<\/p>\n<p>A <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.elliptic.co\/blog\/ukrainians-turn-to-bitcoin-to-crowdfund-the-fight-against-russia\">report<\/a> by Elliptic, a\u00a0London-based\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Blockchain analysis\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blockchain_analysis\">blockchain analysis<\/a> provider, says that in the past the Ukrainian military was not able to not cope on its own.

Bitcoin has also emerged as an important alternative funding method, allowing international donors to bypass financial institutions that are blocking payments to these groups.<\/p>\n<p>One of the largest organizations receiving Bitcoin funding and providing support to the Ukrainian army is the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/savelife.in.ua\/\">Come Back Alive foundation<\/a> Founded in 2014.
