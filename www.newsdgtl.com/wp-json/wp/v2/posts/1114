The NFT in question is Azuki #9605, which is considered<strong> the collection\u2019s second rarest asset<\/strong> due to 6 of its 9 traits being seen in less than 1% of all other NFTs in the collection.<\/p>\n<p>The landmark purchase was made on March 30th by OpenSea user \u2018jdizzles,\u2019 from RedBean DAO member and notorious Azuki NFT holder, \u2018trevault\u2019. It marked the second record-breaking NFT endeavour from the buyer, as last month saw them pay a whopping 200 ETH for Invisible Friends #1125, an amount previously unseen within the collection.<\/p>\n<p>The sale also trumps the previous Azuki NFT sales record, which stood at $560,000.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The project\u2019s founders, LA startup Chiru Labs, released the 10,000 asset collection back in January, however over its first two months of action, it has already become the most sought-after anime-themed project in the space, as signalled by its generation of <strong>over $500 million in OpenSea sales<\/strong>. As described by the founders themselves, the project\u2019s popularity may stem through its provision of access to a corner of the internet where art, community, and culture fuse to create magic.<\/p>\n<p>As expected, interest in Azuki #9605 has continued following its high-profile sale, as currently, a bid of a little over 60 ETH (which is 242% above the collection\u2019s 17.65 ETH floor price) has been made, however as economics would suggest, a reinstated record-breaking bid will probably have to be made in order to take the asset from jdizzles\u2019 grasp.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Follow Azuki &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AzukiOfficial\">Twitter<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
