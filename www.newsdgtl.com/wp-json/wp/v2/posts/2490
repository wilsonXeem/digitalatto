The new concept is dubbed the \u2018HN NFT Vault,\u2019 and will essentially serve as <strong>a physical NFT marketplace<\/strong> where customers can conveniently browse, purchase, and even sell NFTs via swift and secure transactions.<\/p>\n<p>On brand with the store\u2019s luxury appeal, the concept exclusively caters to NFTs of the blue chip variety, meaning only assets from collections such as<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, CloneX x Takashi Murakami, Azuki and Doodles collections are likely to be on display.<\/p>\n<p>With this in mind, the prices of the digital assets on offer in the store range from HK$5,000 (US$637) to more than HK$1 million (US$127,490), meaning<strong> a casual hit of retail therapy<\/strong> most probably won\u2019t be on the cards for many of its visitors.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>That being said, for those with the financial backing to make a novel purchase in the store, they can do so via cryptocurrency or a credit card, and can also store their digital purchases in a cold wallet. In addition, customers will also be able to create and purchase apparel based on their NFTs.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In wake of its launch on Wednesday, a spokesperson from the global fashion retailer had this to say: <i>\u201cThrough the new space, Harvey Nichols aims to make NFTs more accessible to a broader audience by featuring a range of NFTs from some of the most successful projects globally available for in-store exploration and purchase\u201d.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>To extend upon the first-of-its-kind concept, the company may also be launching a service which allows <strong>NFT homeowners<\/strong> to showcase and promote their NFTs via the HN NFT Vault. However, only NFTs from respected initiatives will likely be accepted in the project, as the HN NFT Vault has employed a rigid vetting policy when deciding which NFTs are worthy of being showcased.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
