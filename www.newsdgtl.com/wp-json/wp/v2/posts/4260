Although, SOL was moving sideways, the technical pointed towards a possible bullish revival. Nearest resistance line for the coin stood at $60 and if the coin struggles too much to break past the aforementioned level then SOL could attempt to visit the next support line.<\/p>\n<p>The next price floor for SOL was at $44.85 and then at $34. Solana has visited these levels almost over ten months ago when the coin was on a bullish price action.<\/p>\n<p>Bullishness can be pointed out because SOL has just managed to bounce off the long standing support line (yellow) of $40 on the above chart. This particular price action can be attributed to a further upside movement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><b><i>Related Reading |<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/solana\/solana-tvl-sees-sharp-decline-reaches-2022-low\/\"> Solana TVL Sees Sharp Decline, Reaches 2022 Low<\/a><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>One Hour Chart<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_491165\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-491165\" style=\"width: 1816px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-491165 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/SOLUSD_2022-05-23_21-02-55.png\" alt=\"Solana\" width=\"1816\" height=\"706\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-491165\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Solana formed an ascending triangle on the one hour chart | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/SOLUSD\/?exchange=BINANCEUS\"><strong>Source: SOLUSD on TradingView<\/strong><\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>An ascending triangle has been formed on the one hour chart.
