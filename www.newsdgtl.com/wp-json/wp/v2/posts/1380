Our sister site Bitcoinist explains and clarifies:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe company took the loan via MacroStrategy, a subsidiary created with the purpose of holding its parent company\u2019s Bitcoin funds. As per the release, the $205 million loans were issued under the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) and its Leverage program and will mature on March 23, 2025.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The SEN was launched in 2020, the release clarified, to address the demand for BTC collateralized loans.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even though 129,218 BTC is a lot for just one entity, it\u2019s beneficial to remember that those are not Michael Saylor\u2019s coins. The treasury belongs to MicroStrategy, a public company owned by many. Still, they own almost triple what Tesla owns.
