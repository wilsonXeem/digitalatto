The financial institution has begun tightening its monetary policies after years of low-interest rates and high liquidity across the markets.<\/p>\n<p>According to a recent <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/insights.glassnode.com\/the-week-onchain-week-21-2022\/\">report<\/a> from on-chain research firm Glassnode, Bitcoin entered bear market territory in 2021. At that time, expectations of higher interest rates from the FED saw an uptick.<\/p>\n<p>The firm believes that May and July 2021 selloff was the \u201cgenesis\u201d of the current bear market. This coincides with a dropped in the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for Bitcoin and Ethereum.<\/p>\n<p>This metric is used to measure returns and has been on a decline every year since BTC became a tradable asset. The recent dropped in BTC\u2019s returns, the research firm said, is worse than when the cryptocurrency crashed from the mid-area around $50,000 to $42,000.<\/p>\n<p>As seen below, Glassnode claims this dropped in CAGR or returns coincides with the starts and ends of BTC bear markets. In terms of returns, May-July 2021 behaved similarly and even recorded a steeper decline than today\u2019s negative 30% drop in this metric.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_491158\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-491158\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-491158 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSD-7-860x496.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin BTC BTCUSD\" width=\"860\" height=\"496\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-491158\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Glassnode<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>If history is to repeat, Bitcoin should see some relief in the short term. This potential bounce might not mark the definitive bottom of the downside trend.<\/p>\n<h2>Players Bet On More Future Bitcoin Downside Price Action<\/h2>\n<p>Market participants are expecting this scenario. For the next two to three months, Glassnode noted, there is an increase in the number of put (sell) options for Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p>The strike prices for these options stand at $25,000, $20,000, and $15,000. Call (buy) options, the research firm claimed, are lower with most bullish traders aiming for a bounce to $40,000 over the same period. Glassnode said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This suggests that at least out to the middle of the year, the market has a strong preference for hedging risk, and\/or speculating on further downside price action.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin-reclaims-30k-territory\/\">Bitcoin Reclaims $30K Territory After Recent Weeks\u2019 Struggle \u2013 Analysts Weigh In<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Over the long term, the options market is bullish.
