The program aims to accelerate early-stage teams building projects in the Filecoin ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>Established in 2018, the LongHashX a Web3 investment fund and accelerator, has partnered with notable ecosystems such as Polkadot, Algorand, and Filecoin, among others. Past graduates from Filecoin Cohorts include Lit Protocol, a decentralized access control network; Huddle01, a decentralized secure video calling app; and Lighthouse, a permanent storage protocol.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<i>We are very excited to continue our partnership with Protocol Labs as we launch the third LongHashX Accelerator Filecoin Cohort. As demand for decentralized storage grows, Filecoin is well-placed to be the leading choice for Web3 developers. We are looking forward to more NFT, GameFi, and Metaverse use cases, as well as middleware, infrastructure, and tooling protocols using Filecoin. As a long-time partner of Protocol Labs, we are proud to witness the tremendous growth of the Filecoin ecosystem<\/i>,\u201d said Emma Cui, Founding Partner and CEO of LongHash Ventures.<\/p>\n<p>The 12-week program includes a series of workshops and fireside chats across six modules, namely Product Strategy &amp; Design, Tokenomics, Governance, Tech Mentorship, Community Building, and Fundraising.
