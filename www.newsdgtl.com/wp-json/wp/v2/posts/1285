There are very few cases when a crypto project was launched without initial funds and succeeded. Hence, developers usually ensure that a project has an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or an Initial DEX Offering (IDO).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These initial token sales are getting more popular nowadays, as it is more accessible to new startups that want to fundraise more efficiently. They make sure that projects can gain funds so that they can develop their projects as promised to the community. It\u2019s worth noting that the rise of the crypto market in 2021 led to the creation of thousands of new cryptocurrencies. With each of them aiming for the moon, it became essential to use as many initial sales so that cryptocurrencies could compete in a rather competitive environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how can you have these initial token sales? The answer to that is crypto launchpads. This article focuses on crypto launchpads and the best launchpads for 2022.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are Crypto Launchpads?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, crypto launchpads serve as the medium for new crypto startups to secure and raise equity. Any blockchain-based technology can use crypto launchpads and allow interested investors to have access to token sales prior to the public launch. These launchpads usually have low fees and allow investors to invest earlier than the rest while paying fewer fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, developers can accurately depict what their project entails through the launchpads. This also enables other investors to find out about the token besides the already-existing community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest advantage of launchpads could be the fact that each project needs to be verified. This means that launchpads prevent scams from occurring. No one can launch an initial sale on the launchpad, take the money, and leave the project after getting the money. Hence, launchpads have revolutionized the way that cryptocurrencies are launched.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what are some of the best crypto launchpads that could prove to be key in 2022?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best Crypto Launchpads for 2022<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PinkSale<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quite easily, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pinksale.finance\">PinkSale<\/a> is one of the best crypto launchpad protocols currently in the market.

It offers users the to launch their BSC-based tokens with ease, which millions of users have access to. Hence, the Binance Launchpad is mainly focused on targeting Binance users.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good thing about the Binance Launchpad is that there are many success stories on this launchpad. It has proved to be quite an effective fundraising tool so far, and it may as well continue to be so throughout 2022. With BSC being one of the most used chains in the market, the Binance Launchpad has loads of potential to have increased user volume in the coming months.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BSC Pad<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A direct competitor to the Binance Launchpad, the BSC LaunchPad is yet another promising crypto launchpad. Also focused on BSC tokens, the BSC Pad is actually the first IDO launchpad in the Binance Smart Chain.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A big advantage of the BSC pad is that it also offers an anti-bot system, just like PinkSale. This means that no automated system can automatically fill whitelist spots for an investor during the presale. Hence, BSC Pad focuses on giving everyone a fair chance of participating in limited-time IDOs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BSC Pad also has its utility token with the same name. BSCPAD powers this launchpad, and it makes sure that the goal to make each launch is as fair to users as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unicrypt<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another crypto launchpad worth putting on this list is Unicrypt. Unicrypt aims to make launchpads as accessible as possible to three different parties: developers, incubators, and investors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They aim to make token development as easy as possible. Unicrypt\u2019s technology and its partnerships that can thoroughly review your project have made this feature realistic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For incubators, Unicrypt aims to become be an efficient token incubator and fundraiser.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For investors, they aim to be as user-friendly as possible so that anyone can easily participate in initial sales.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unicrypt also provides launchpad services to three different chains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TrustPad<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TrustPad is one of the safest decentralized fundraisers in the market. Also built on the Binance Smart Chain, TrustPad supports Ethereum and Solana. Moreover, TrustPad supports the Certik Skynet, making security a priority.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TrustPad has partnerships with major institutional investors, including Twin Apex Capital, meridian Capital, Tokenova, Lupa X, Wealth Union, 4SV, etc. These partnerships further show the growth potential that TrustPad has as a multi-chain launchpad. TurstPad\u2019s native token is TPAD. Users can stake TPAD and gain earlier access to some of the token sales. Hence, TrustPad could benefit both investors and developers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">StarPunk<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last but not least, StarPunk is yet another top choice as a launchpad. Starting off as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), StarPunk mainly provides startup opportunities to NFT and decentralized gaming cryptocurrencies, such as the likes of Axie Infinity. With play-to-earn becoming much more relevant nowadays, StarPunk could see huge growth in user count in 2022. Besides its token auction system, it has tons of other decentralized services that make it one of the best launchpads on the list. StarPunk is currently working on securing more partnerships so that new decentralized games might be launched. Each incubator can deploy its games in StarPunk and raise funds due to the latter\u2019s ever-growing community.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeaways<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Successful cryptocurrencies usually have initial token sales before public launch.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The easiest way to have an initial token sale is through crypto launchpads.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PinkSale and StarPunk are a few of the best crypto launchpads for 2022.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other worth-noting launchpads are the Binance Launchpad, the BSC Pad, Unicrypt, TrustPad, etc.<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\">\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/shibaswifecommunity\"><img src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" style=\"width:auto ;height:auto;\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/1649062395_495_ShibasWifeBannerGif3-1.gif\"\/><noscript><img src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/1649062395_495_ShibasWifeBannerGif3-1.gif\" style=\"width:auto ;height:auto;\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 2 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/best-crypto-launchpads-2022-detailed-review\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every crypto project needs to have initial funds to have a successful launch and then develop further.
