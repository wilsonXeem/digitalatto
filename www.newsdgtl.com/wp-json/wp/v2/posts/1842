Recorded on the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/alternative.me\/crypto\/fear-and-greed-index\/\">Fear &amp; Greed Index<\/a>, it shows that this remains an incredibly frightening time for users of cryptocurrencies. In times like these when the prices of digital assets continue to slide down, it is expected that investors become warier. However, this time around, the market had quickly gone into \u201cExtreme Fear\u201d territory with no sign of emerging anytime soon.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Scared Of Investing?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">At the start of the month, top cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum had begun a recovery trend that would eventually wash over the rest of the market. As prices rose, so did positive sentiment among investors who had flooded back into the market. Not long after though, the market had started one of its signature correction trends that comes with the bull rally and now investors have chosen to retreat instead of risk further downside.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/cefi-platform-celsius-restricts-yield-rewards-to-only-accredited-investors-in-u-s\/\">CeFi Platform Celsius Restricts Yield Rewards To Only Accredited Investors In U.S.<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Fear &amp; Greed Index shows that the market had been on a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/alternative.me\/crypto\/fear-and-greed-index\/\">downward sliding scale<\/a> since coming out of last week which had ended with a neutral sentiment from both sides of the market. By Monday however, this had quickly turned into fear with bitcoin finally falling to the $43K territory. Tuesday in itself proved to be worse as the market had indeed fallen into extreme fear, leading to a low score of 20.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Now, while Wednesday is starting out better than what Tuesday ended with at a score of 25, it still does not spell good news for the short term. When investors are scared of the market, they tend to not put any money into it for fear of losing more. This also triggers people taking profits from the market due to fear of their coins dropping further in value. With such low momentum, prices can suffer more instead of staging another recovery.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Is Fear Good For Crypto?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">When it comes to how the market is feeling towards cryptocurrencies, it can often be a matter of personal perspective. There are those who believe that steering clear of the market while it is fearful is the best bet and to only invest once the prices start recovering. However, there are those who believe the opposite.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/the-ronin-hack-aftermatch-axie-infinity-1m-bug-bounty\/\">The Ronin Hack Aftermatch: Axie Infinity\u2019s $1M Bug Bounty<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Those who subscribe to the \u201cbuy the blood\u201d school of thought often welcome downtrends like these since it gives them the opportunity to purchase coins at a \u201cdiscount.\u201d This mainly comes down to the risk appetite of the investor.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nevertheless, it still stands to reason that some of the largest rallies have come after the market has consolidated from a price drop.
