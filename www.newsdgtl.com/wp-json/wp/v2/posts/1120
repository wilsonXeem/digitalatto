The project offers a refreshing alternative to the space through its mission to reward its community whilst simultaneously allowing them to enjoy its virtual Pawn Shop locations across Decentraland and The Sandbox.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The project will release two types of NFTs with the intention of rewarding owners on a monthly basis. Let\u2019s take a look at what collectors can expect.<\/p>\n<h4><b>The Gold and Silver Collections<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Yoseo Pawn Shop NFTs come in two collections, with both offering holders the chance to earn a passive income through their ownership.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The first set is the <strong>Gold Collection<\/strong>, which consists of 1,000 NFTs created from over 200 traits. 10% of Pawn Shop\u2019s monthly profits will be split between the NFT holders.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>The second category is the <strong>Silver Collection<\/strong>, which consists of 10,000 NFTs created from over 500 traits. 50% of the project\u2019s monthly profits will be split between the collection\u2019s 10,000 NFTs.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>The remaining 40% of the profit allocation will be distributed to devs (10%), marketing and exposure initiatives (10%), and increasing the lending pool (20%). To maximise the success of the project going forwards, as well as the income generated for its community, these proportions are adjustable (in line with profit increases). This will help facilitate making investments in future metaverse expansions and increasing the lending pool.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The project will also <strong>add extra rewards to those who purchase multiple Yoseo Pawn Shop NFTs<\/strong>, as those holding 5 Gold Collection NFTs and 5 Silver Collection NFTs will be granted access to the project\u2019s inner circle of decision makers, as well as its whitelist.<\/p>\n<h4><b>The Drops<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>The <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/mint.yoseopawnshop.com\/mint-2\">mint<\/a> for Gold Collection NFTs is already live, with <strong>each<\/strong> <strong>digital asset costing 0.1 ETH<\/strong>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>On April 12th, the mint for Silver Collection NFTs will be launched, however only 9,500 will be on sale, as 500 will be reserved for those with pre-sale access, as well as for various giveaways.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Roadmap<\/b><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>As of April 2022, the project intends to buy ten 1 x 1 LANDs for Pawn Shops and Portals in Decentraland, as well as ten 1 x 1 LANDs for Pawn Shops and Portals in The Sandbox.<\/p>\n<p>Stage 2, which takes place from April to September, will see the<strong> virtual construction of the Pawn Shops<\/strong> in Decentraland and The Sandbox. Other developments will also unfold, such as the building of a Pawn Shop website, as an alternative to the Decentraland and The Sandbox locations.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout this time, the project also aims to purchase one LAND plot in Infinity Void, whilst also developing and expanding its plots of virtual land every month, in order to increase the income of the holders each month.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-35568 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/yoseo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"859\" height=\"871\"  \/><\/p>\n<h4><b>Team<\/b><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>The project\u2019s <strong>doxxed team<\/strong> is comprised of five members; two coveted co-founders who run the show, a professional web designer and SDK specialist, a holistic community builder, and a social media specialist.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Follow Yoseo Pawn Shop &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yoseopawnshop\">Twitter<\/a>\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
