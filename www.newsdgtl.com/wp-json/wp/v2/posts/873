Brandt called for <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/peter-brandt-bitcoin-price-bottom\/\">a full 80% or more retrace<\/a> in the price per coin of the top cryptocurrency almost a full year before it landed at his target.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/peter-brandt-bitcoin-price-bottom\/\">Peter Brandt Calls For 80%+ Bitcoin Price Decline With Chilling Accuracy<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Unlike what is commonly seen throughout the crypto world, Brandt doesn\u2019t rely on complex technical indicators, buy or sell signals, or <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/bitcoin-on-chain-demands-suggests-that-the-market-has-reached-its-bottom\/\">on-chain metrics<\/a>. All he uses are straight or curved lines, which often accurately represent a contained trend. When such lines are violated, a trend change often follows.<\/p>\n<p>With Bitcoin breaking above the top of an ascending triangle trend line, is Brandt specifically calling attention to a trend change ahead? If so, paying closer attention to the comparison between each major crypto bottom could be critical.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Follow <\/i><\/b><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tonyspilotroBTC\"><b><i>@TonySpilotroBTC on Twitter<\/i><\/b><\/a><b><i> or join\u00a0<\/i><\/b><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/TonyTradesBTC\"><b><i>the TonyTradesBTC Telegram<\/i><\/b><\/a><b><i> for exclusive daily market insights and technical analysis education<\/i><\/b><b><i>.
