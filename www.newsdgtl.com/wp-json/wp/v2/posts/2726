The U.S. inflation struggles at a four-decade high and Fed rate hike fears prevail. The uncertainty extends to the world economy as a recession is expected instead of a recovery. The IMF\u2019s managing director Kristalina Georgieva called it \u201ca crisis on top of a crisis.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe war is a supply shock that reduces economic output and raises prices. Indeed, we forecast inflation will accelerate to 5.5 percent in advanced economies and to 9.3 percent in emerging European economies excluding Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. \u201d The IMF <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/blogs.imf.org\/2022\/04\/22\/war-in-ukraine-is-serious-setback-to-europes-economic-recovery\/\">stated<\/a> last week.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Reuters recently <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/global-precious-idAFL3N2WC1TY\">quoted<\/a> Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann, who talked in a note about the factors that have \u201clent buoyancy to gold in recent days,\u201d mentioning the \u201cstrong buying interest on the part of ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) investors\u201d and news about the Ukraine war.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cRussia appears to be preparing to launch a major offensive in the east of the country \u2013 that is generating considerable demand for gold as a safe haven,\u201d the analyst said.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This summarizes the \u201crisk-off\u201d sentiment at the moment. As expected, equities suffer as investors are selling risky assets and purchasing the ones negatively correlated to the traditional market. Thus, the crypto space is struggling alongside de stocks market and gold is rising.<\/p>\n<h2>Bitcoin Outperformed By Gold<\/h2>\n<p>Data from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.research.arcane.no\/\">Arcane Research\u2019s latest weekly report<\/a> notes that it has been a gloomy year for the \u201cdigital gold.\u201d In the first three weeks of 2022, Bitcoin sank 25% and it is still down by 18% in the year despite its slight recovery.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, Nasdaq records a 19% decline in the year, having underperformed against bitcoin \u201cby a small margin,\u201d notes the report, adding that \u201cThis is surprising given that bitcoin has tended to follow Nasdaq, albeit with higher volatility.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The general fear over geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty has given gold the safe-haven asset spotlight once more. The asset outperformed all the other indexes seen below with a 4% gain.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_489121\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-489121\" style=\"width: 605px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-489121\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screen-Shot-2022-04-27-at-8.10.24-PM.png\" alt=\"bitcoin\" width=\"605\" height=\"509\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-489121\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Physical gold outperforming \u201cdigital gold\u201d in 2022 | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.research.arcane.no\/\">Arcane Research<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Meanwhile, the currency market is performing with \u201cthe same risk-off patterns.\u201d The Dollar has been proving its \u201crisk-off\u201d dominance as the US Dollar Index (DXY) is up 7%.
