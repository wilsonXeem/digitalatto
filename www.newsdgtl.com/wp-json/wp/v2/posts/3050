Here is a closer look at the 3-day Stochastic on BTCUSD price charts.<\/p>\n<h2>The Stochastic Oscillator Explained<\/h2>\n<p>The Stochastic oscillator is a a range-bound momentum indicator that uses support and resistance levels, created by investment educator George Lane in the 1950s. According to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stochastic_oscillator\">Wikipedia<\/a>, \u201cThe term stochastic refers to the point of a current price in relation to its price range over a period of time. This method attempts to predict price turning points by comparing the closing price of a security to its price range.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"row-title\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/bitcoin-market-cycle-comparison-crypto\/\" aria-label=\"\u201cBitcoin Perfectly Follows Market Cycle Comparison, What Comes Next For Crypto?\u201d (Edit)\">Bitcoin Perfectly Follows Market Cycle Comparison, What Comes Next For Crypto?<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The formula provides an asset\u2019s price expressed as a percentage of its price range between 0% and 100%. The goal of the Stochastic \u2013 often called Stoch for short \u2013 is to spot when prices close near the extremes of a recent range. It is at this point where reversals are most likely to occur. Simply put, the lower the reading, the more oversold and the more likely a bounce is due. The higher the reading, the higher the likelihood of a rejection due to overbought conditions.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-489593 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/BTCUSD_2022-05-03_09-22-56-860x415.png\" alt=\"BTCUSD_2022-05-03_09-22-56\" width=\"860\" height=\"415\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTCUSD saw 10,000%+ ROI following the low | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/BTCUSD\/\">BTCUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2>Bitcoin Bulls Attempt To Put In A Bottom<\/h2>\n<p>Currently, Bitcoin price on 3-day timeframes is at the lowest point in its entire history. The only other time as low, was at the 2015 bear market bottom. A second-bottom followed in the months after, followed by price appreciation upwards of 10,000%. From a low of under $200 per BTC, the top cryptocurrency skyrocketed to nearly $20,000. Crypto was put on the map forever after \u2013 <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/bitcoin-market-cycle-comparison-crypto\/\">what happens this time<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>For now, bulls aren\u2019t out of the woods. The Stochastic oscillator consists of a fast stochastic\u00a0(%K) and a slow stochastic (%D). A signal to take action is triggered when these two lines cross. Bears are in the process of defending a 3-day bull cross, while bulls seek to put in a bottom once and for all.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-489597 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/BTCUSD_2022-05-03_10-18-38-860x415.png\" alt=\"BTCUSD_2022-05-03_10-18-38\" width=\"860\" height=\"415\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">The bullish crossover hasn't yet been completed | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/BTCUSD\/\">BTCUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p>Both the Stochastic and RSI are used to signal overbought and oversold conditions.
