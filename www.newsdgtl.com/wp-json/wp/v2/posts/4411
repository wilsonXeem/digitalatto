Whereas Ethereum is home to 486 different DeFi protocols.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the imminent release of ErgoDEX will go some way to addressing concerns over the lack of dApps on Cardano.<\/p>\n<h2>Who is Ergo?<\/h2>\n<p>Ergo launched n <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cardanocube.io\/projects\/ergodex\">2019<\/a> as an advanced Proof-of-Work (PoW) chain, featuring technologies such as zk-proofs and adjustable block size, with the added twist of being ASIC resistant.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cErgo is a proof of work (PoW) blockchain platform with Turing complete smart contracts that employs a number of advanced features like zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, oracles, and adjustable block size.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Proponents of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/academy.binance.com\/en\/glossary\/asic-resistant\">ASIC resistance<\/a> argue that it leads to greater decentralization, as there is no benefit to mining with ASIC machines compared to a GPU. As such, ASIC-resistant chains are minable by hobbyists and everyday people.<\/p>\n<p>The team partnered with the commercial arm of Cardano, EMURGO, in <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cardanocube.io\/projects\/ergodex\">2020<\/a>, to explore research and develop stablecoin technology and \u201cthe provision of DeFi applications.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One of the outcomes of this partnership is the ErgoDEX, which is due for rollout soon. However, the Ergo ecosystem also includes the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/coinmonks\/ergo-and-cardano-combine-to-create-the-ultimate-blockchain-platform-e26a01d99bfa\">SigUSD<\/a> stablecoin.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the benefits to Cardano?<\/h2>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/ergoplatform.org\/en\/blog\/2021-07-21-ergodex-a-cross-chain-workhorse\/\">ErgoDEX<\/a> will allow users to trade assets and provide liquidity much like any other DEX. But ErgoDEX will offer the added benefit of cross-chain liquidity and interoperability between the Ergo and Cardano chains.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cA noncustodial, decentralised exchange that allows a quick, effortless and secure transfer of liquidity between the Ergo and Cardano networks.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It will also include <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/coinmonks\/ergo-and-cardano-combine-to-create-the-ultimate-blockchain-platform-e26a01d99bfa\">CEX-like features<\/a> such as limit orders, partial filling, and buy-back supports. Plus, by making use of \u201cmulti-stage contracts,\u201d users can also take advantage of timed-release payments. This is particularly useful in giving users the option to cancel orders if something goes wrong.<\/p>\n<div class=\"edge-cta hidden\">\n<h2>Get an <span>Edge<\/span> on the Crypto Market \ud83d\udc47<\/h2>\n<p>Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cols\">\n<p> <span class=\"img chart\"\/> <strong>On-chain analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> <span class=\"img price\"\/> <strong>Price snapshots<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> <span class=\"img context\"\/> <strong>More context<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.memberful.com\/checkout?plan=43765\" class=\"btn join\">Join now for $19\/month<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/edge\/\" class=\"btn\">Explore all benefits<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/ergodex-prepares-for-imminent-launch-on-cardano\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ud83d\udc4b Want to work with us?
