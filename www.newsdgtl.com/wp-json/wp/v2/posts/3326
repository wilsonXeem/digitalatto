Since then, the popularity of NFTs has soared even higher. In short, if you have an NFT project to launch in the near future, chances are you\u2019re going to need all the help you can if you want to stand out in an already crowded market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>So how can you get the word out about your project?<\/strong> Well, having deep pockets and friends in the right places always helps, but for those without either, here\u2019s a tried and tested way to cut through the static.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Storytelling is a time-honoured method of spreading information. Ever since we learned to communicate, as a species we\u2019ve used stories to spread knowledge. Now, like everything else in life, there are good ways to tell a story and bad ways to tell a story, and knowing the difference can make <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ALL<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, here are three ways to use storytelling to share your NFT project.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Be Unique<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to elevate your project above others make sure it\u2019s not like anything else. Making the story behind your NFT project unique will not only help people remember it, it can help them find it again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Chances are the first time anyone stumbles across your project it will be just that a stumble. Maybe they\u2019ll see a link on Reddit or catch sight of an ad, but chances are it will just slip by unnoticed unless the story catches their imagination. Yet even if it does, there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll follow the link or even remember the project name.<\/p>\n<p>However, if your story does reach them and lodges in their mind, if the story is one of a kind, chances are good that they\u2019ll be able to search for it and find it again. Of course, <strong>capturing someone\u2019s imagination<\/strong> in seconds leads us nicely into the second tip on our list.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Be Succinct<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a place for your novella, your white paper, and maybe even the screenplay for your live-action animated series. However, there\u2019s also a place for the razor-sharp abridged version, and this is the one you\u2019ll want to nail first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The internet has shrunk the world and with it our attention span. They used to say a newspaper headline had 15 seconds to snare a reader, these days we\u2019re lucky if we give a tenth of that. Snagging attention in nanoseconds requires some skill and some would argue talent.<\/p>\n<p>You can of course hire a pro, but high-ticket copywriters are just that and until you can afford the fees that come with their skill, it\u2019s a good idea to<strong> try writing this copy yourself<\/strong>. This part of your story is the tagline. It\u2019s the 10-to-30-word summation that pulls the reader in but leaves them hungry.<\/p>\n<p>These are the headlines you see on film posters and the equivalent of the elevator pitches hungry screenwriters hurl at every director they happen upon on the streets of Tinsel Town. Take time to find the best 30 words to describe your project and then buy yourself a beer\/soda for every word you can shave off.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Be Honest<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crypto-curious can smell nonsense like sharks sniff blood. When composing your story, stick to the facts and try not to exaggerate. Remember, having faith and even a little bit of pride in your project is one thing, but tell it like it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Also, avoid over-hyping your project with so-called power-packed words and huge sweeping statements. Unless you are literally going to change the world, don\u2019t say world-changing. Unless you plan to tear down the establishment and dance in the ashes, don\u2019t call it a revolution.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Instead, be open and transparent, and even humble.<\/strong> God knows there\u2019s enough FUD Fear Misinformation and Doubt in the crypto world as it is and the last thing you want to do is let potential investors think you\u2019re going to add more.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
