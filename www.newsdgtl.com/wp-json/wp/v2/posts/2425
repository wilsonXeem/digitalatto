And all of these structures indicate that there there could be <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-bear-market-comparison-time-for-bull-season\/\">a grand finale<\/a> still left to complete a motive wave with a powerful wave five.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Ongoing Sideways Is More Painful Than Black Thursday<\/h2>\n<p>If this is what could still be ahead, then why exactly is sentiment so bearish? For one, bearish sentiment is often the driver of a wave five. At this point in the trend, fundamentals are no longer improving at the same pace that pulled in market participants. Profit taking is increasing.<\/p>\n<p>Wave fives are FOMO-driven. And how does that FOMO develop? By having a market on the wrong side of the trade, due to overly bearish sentiment. Such a situation leads to participants chasing entries as prices soar higher.<\/p>\n<p>Bearish sentiment is a result of positioning. Bears have either sold, are short, or expect more downside. Sentiment is so bearish not because Bitcoin has seen horrific new lows like<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/bitcoin-price-forecast-calls-for-chance-of-black-thursday-redux\/\"> Black Thursday<\/a>. Sentiment is so bearish because it has taken almost twice as long to go exactly nowhere.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-488741 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/BTCUSD_2022-04-22_09-54-23-860x391.png\" alt=\"BTCUSD_2022-04-22_09-54-23\" width=\"860\" height=\"391\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Sideways stabs more painfully than a sharp correction | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/BTCUSD\/\">BTCUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p>If Black Thursday, put in the \u201csharp\u201d wave two bottom, then the market could be painfully moving \u201csideways\u201d in wave four per Elliott Wave\u2019s <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.elliottwave.net\/educational\/basictenets\/basics4.htm#:~:text=The%20guideline%20of%20alternation%20states,sideways%20correction%2C%20and%20vice%20versa.\">law of alternation<\/a>. Although the March 2020 correction took BTCUSD down more than 70% from wave one high to wave two low, it only took around 250 days. The intra-cycle peaks on the RSI as the wave three top puts in a potential wave four bottom at roughly the same exact price as it was 14 months ago.<\/p>\n<p>Even though investors haven\u2019t lost anything in value since then, there is the cost of their time. This correction has gone sideways but taken more than 460 days to mostly go nowhere. Even the bear market itself took only 370 days to reach a capitulation bottom. In a world where instant gratification is commonplace, Bitcoin was expected to already be more than $100K, a war is waging, an economic crisis is looming, and more \u2014 no wonder why the masses are so bearish on Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/now-or-never-bitcoin-builds-base-at-decade-long-parabolic-pattern\/\">Now Or Never: Bitcoin Builds Base At Decade-Long Parabolic Curve<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>But what if they\u2019re wrong, and wave five remains?
