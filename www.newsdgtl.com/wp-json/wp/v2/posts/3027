Despite being the driving force behind the Apes and their trademark nonchalance.<\/p>\n<p>If Seneca had known what would transpire, tighter contracts and royalty payments would all have been negotiated. As it stands, what she has come away with is far more valuable, it\u2019s the stone-cold proof that she has what it takes to dominate the industry.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I think more than anything, my biggest win out of beginning my web3 life is just having the chance to meet such able and talented people I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise crossed paths with.

Throughout that time, Seneca has discovered her artwork has become a sensation, and since then learned to embrace the non-fungible and turn it into a <strong>lucrative opportunity<\/strong> on her own terms.<\/p>\n<p>So, with this in mind, the first four all-Seneca NFTs made their way to the Art Basel event back in December. Four exceptional pieces that demonstrate far more artistic merit than 10k cartoon monkeys ever could. Through the depictions within, the artist calls upon a hypnotic range of colours, <strong>channelling her inner Alice<\/strong> to convey vivid emotions through the medium of psychedelia.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Seneca continues her non-fungible journey, and thanks to the sale of her first four NFTs has the funds to sustain her while she creates. So, heading into the second year her designs have circulated the NFT domain, we can expect more of her visionary style to permeate the blockchain.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Follow Seneca on Twitter &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/allseeingseneca\">Here<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
