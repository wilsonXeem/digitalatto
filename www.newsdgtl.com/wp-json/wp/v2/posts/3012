Now, the developers aim to implement Proof-Of-Stake between Q1 to Q2 2022. Thus, miners receive extra time to withdraw profit from their GPU, which can adversely affect the availability of GPUs in retail.<\/p>\n<p>However, staking enthusiasts shouldn\u2019t just sit around waiting for this big day. Moreover, this is not the first time Buterin\u2019s team has postponed it. Meantime, we offer one up-and-coming project \u2013 <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.zilliqa.com\/\">Zilliqa<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It is one of the fastest-growing blockchains worldwide that offers its users DeFi and the simplest way to create user-friendly dApps. This is an open and transparent platform with marketplaces where users can mint items and turn them into unchangeable and tamper-proof NFTs. Zilliqa embraces Metapolis, a groundbreaking metaverse-as-a-service (MaaS) platform built on the top of Zilliqa blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>The Zilliqa blockchain is safe and secure. It was developed by the brightest minds and experienced people in the industry. The platform offers lower transaction fees and developer-friendly smart contract language. Its consensus protocol was designed with sustainability in mind. As the network grows, the transaction capacity increases too.<\/p>\n<p>As the Zilliqa blockchain is easy-to-handle, even a beginner can create decentralized apps on top of Zilliqa and take advantage of this blockchain\u2019s benefits. dApps bring business to a brand new level as they open smarter options for creative industries, gaming, banking, etc.<\/p>\n<h3>Zilliqa Achievements<\/h3>\n<p>In March 2022, the ZIL token became one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, boosting from $0.045 to $0.186, which is a 300% growth. On March 31, the growth was fixed at the level of 321%. Amid such rapid growth, ZIL has become an extremely attractive token for miners, and they started to massively join <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/ezil.me\/\">Ezil Pool<\/a>, which is a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/miningpoolstats.stream\/zilliqa\">number one pool for Zilliqa<\/a>. The Ezil Pool made it to the top 10 pools in terms of hashrate. It offers several withdrawal methods, which help ETH miners save up to 20%.<\/p>\n<p>Check out the comparison below:<\/p>\n<table width=\"602\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"201\">\u00a0<\/td>\n<td width=\"201\"><strong>Ethermine<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"201\"><strong>Ezil<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"201\">Fee<\/td>\n<td width=\"201\">1%<\/td>\n<td width=\"201\">1%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"201\">Coins<\/td>\n<td width=\"201\">ETH\/ETC<\/td>\n<td width=\"201\">ETH\/ETC+ZIL<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"201\">Reward method<\/td>\n<td width=\"201\">PPLNS<\/td>\n<td width=\"201\">PPLNS, PPS+<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"201\">Payment method<\/td>\n<td width=\"201\">ETH, Polygon<\/td>\n<td width=\"201\">ETH, Polygon, BSC, OEC, HECO, Arbitrum<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"201\">Detailed reports<\/td>\n<td width=\"201\">No<\/td>\n<td width=\"201\">Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>The pool has a user-friendly interface and 24\/7 customer support. 2.1% of the world\u2019s\u00a0 ETH and 20.51% of ZIL are mined with ezil.me every day.<\/p>\n<h3>Wrapping up<\/h3>\n<p>As the Ezil Pool has become <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/miningpoolstats.stream\/zilliqa\">one of the top mining pools<\/a>, Zilliqa is an up-and-coming project with one of the fastest blockchains and the most convenient platform for creating dApps, it\u2019s safe to say that mining ZIL is a reasonably good choice.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/company\/what-to-stake-in-2022-zilliqa-blockchain-in-figures\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Citing the official crypto developers\u2019 resource, CoinDesk reported that the Ethereum Foundation has rescheduled the transition to the Proof-Of-Stake consensus algorithm.
