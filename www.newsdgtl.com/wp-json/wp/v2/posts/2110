The Terra native cryptocurrency and its ecosystem have managed to attract new users due to its products and staking mechanism.<\/p>\n<p>Two sides of the same coin, LUNA, and Terra\u2019s stablecoin UST have taken over the DeFi sector. Recently, stablecoin became the third largest in terms of market cap.<\/p>\n<p>Only surpass by USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT) with over $50 billion in terms of market cap, UST reached the $17 billion market cap and displaced BUSD.<\/p>\n<p>The increase in market cap could be interpreted as another metric of Terra\u2019s adoption. The ecosystem has attracted attention due to its Anchor Protocol and this project\u2019s 19% annual percentage yield (APY) for staking UST.<\/p>\n<p>Data from Token Terminal measuring LUNA\u2019s transaction volume (in pink in the chart below) confirms the rise of the Terra ecosystem.
