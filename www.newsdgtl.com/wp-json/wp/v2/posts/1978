The prospect of the world&#8217;s wealthiest individual, who has publicly trolled, harassed, and intimidated others, becoming the owner of the immensely influential social media site sparked widespread outrage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The hostile takeover attempt by Musk was chastised by Jackson Palmer, the co-founder of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/elon-musk-dogecoin-social-network\/\">Dogecoin (DOGE)<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many critics believe that Elon Musk\u2019s true motivation is to exact revenge on the United States <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/snake-oil-charge-for-siblings-who-allegedly-defrauded-investors\/\">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)<\/a> because he is far from an advocate of free speech. Elon Musk&#8217;s tweets must be pre-approved prior to publication as a condition of his settlement with the powerful regulator, who he is attempting to evict.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Musk is unsure whether he will prevail in seizing control of Twitter but claims to have a backup plan. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud, a major shareholder in Twitter, has rejected Musk&#8217;s proposal. Additionally, the company&#8217;s board of directors is apparently unwilling to take the offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/hoskinson-proposes-to-team-up-with-elon-musk-for-a-decentralized-twitter\/\">Charles Hoskinson Proposes to Team Up with Elon Musk for a Decentralized Twitter<\/a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\">Crypto Academy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/hoskinson-proposes-to-team-up-with-elon-musk-for-a-decentralized-twitter\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Should the offer Elon Musk made to Twitter be rejected, the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson has proposed he be the backup plan.\u00a0 Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has suggested co-founding a new decentralized social media site with Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla in the event that the billionaire&#8217;s daring bid to take [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1979,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[30],"tags":[41,45,37,44,43,42,40,39],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1978"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1978"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1978\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1980,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1978\/revisions\/1980"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1979"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1978"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1978"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1978"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
