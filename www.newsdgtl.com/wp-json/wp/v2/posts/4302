Meanwhile, 39% were put off by the massive fluctuations in value that have plagued certain cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third most common reason for hesitation was a concern that cryptos as a whole seemed like a scam. This sentiment was most common among baby boomers, 44% of whom selected it as their primary cause for not purchasing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, 18% of crypto skeptics have downloaded crypto exchange apps onto their phones but never ended up investing in any coins. The biggest reason for this sort of course reversal was a lack of knowledge about how to use the app or the currencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Interest Piqued?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto investment interest seems to have taken a hit in 2022, with 61% of respondents saying they are not at all likely to buy in this year. Only 6% of respondents who did not currently own crypto said they would be very or extremely likely to do so in the near future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Positive to know more about cryptocurrencies<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study results point out that interest in learning more about cryptocurrency is not dead. 6 out of 10 people were at least somewhat willing to learn more about cryptocurrency, even if they were not ready to spend money on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts say educating the masses is the need of the hour and relying on word of mouth or sole dependence on the information on media is not good enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anndy Lian, Thought Leader and Chief Digital Advisor to Mongolian Productivity Organization say people should look at reading online expert opinion articles and blogs where real users share their experiences.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis would help them think wider and allow them to make sound decisions on what to do next. Be the changemaker, don&#8217;t be the problem. Crypto changes minds and empowers you to think beyond what you have learned in the textbook,\u201d Lian says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raj Kapoor, chief Advisor at Acryptoverse, a crypto blockchain and advisory firm, says for years crypto has seemed like the fleeting tech trend most people could safely ignore, however, its power &#8211; both economic and cultural &#8211; has become too big to overlook.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe elephant is in the room. Can we kick it out?
