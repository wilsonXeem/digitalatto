The year began at a price of around $0.20, but the price had a bearish surge of more than 40%. After the price of DOGE had a correction of 44% and faced <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/resistance-level-definition\/\">resistance<\/a> at $0.17, the price continued to decline.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dogecoin dropped as low as $0.10 in March of this year, where it managed to find <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-the-support-zone\/\">support<\/a>. After that, the price managed to make a decent recovery, where it increased by around 60% in the following weeks. DOGe once again faced resistance at around $0.17, failing to break a crucial structure that could have proved to be essential for reversing the long-term trend. Nonetheless, this increase moved the candlesticks above the upper Bollinger band, meaning that the price has been highly volatile recently. But, that failed to lead to a change in the momentum for DOGE.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, DOGE is now trading at around $0.13 due to the recent retracement in the price. On a slightly more bullish note, DOGE has been finding support numerous times at this zone, close to $0.13. If the price goes below that, then chances for recovery are smaller in the short run. The overall price movement of the last few weeks has formed a rounding bottom. However, since DOGE failed to break resistance, the price could remain bearish. Nonetheless, another increase in the price could form a cup and handle pattern, which could be bullish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fear and greed index suggests that there is still fear for DOGE traders, but that applies to the rest of the market as well. All in all, the overall trend is still bearish for DOGE in the 1-day chart.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_25053\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-25053\" style=\"width: 2474px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-25053\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Dogecoin (DOGE) Monthly Price Analysis April\" width=\"800\" height=\"403\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/month-2.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-25053\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/month-2.png\" alt=\"Dogecoin (DOGE) Monthly Price Analysis April\" width=\"800\" height=\"403\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-25053\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">DOGE\/USDT 1-Day Chart.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key Structures<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Support<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resistance<\/span><\/h3>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indicators<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving Average<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 20-MA of a 1-day chart is currently above the price of DOGE, meaning that other things equal, the price of DOGE may keep declining in the short run.

On the other hand, if the price has another rebound and forms a cup-and-handle pattern, then we may see DOGE move above $20 in the coming days. Still, a price of $0.50 is far from likely in the short run. When making such price predictions, we must take into account other cryptocurrencies, such as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">BTC<\/a>, which are the main determinants of how the rest of the market performs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Latest News for DOGE \u2013 Affecting Price<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First things first, when it comes to marketing, Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency like no other.
