The hypothesis is backed up by the positivity which surrounds the partnership, as in wake of its announcement last week, 0x\u2019s native token<strong> $ZRX soared 47%<\/strong>, whilst in addition, the 24 hours following its Series B funding round saw the token rise a further 15%. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If the entirety of the $70 million isn\u2019t spent on a high-profile endeavour, then quite likely it will be used to develop new or preexisting features of 0x. In regards to what these features are,<strong> 0x is an open-source decentralized exchange platform<\/strong> that aids in peer-to-peer asset exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>Through its liquidity application programming interface, developers can split up transactions between decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, Curve and Oasis, to find the best prices and throughput. To help the process, the protocol also incorporates Matcha, a global liquidity and markets search engine that helps users trade tokens at the best prices.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
