It was built on the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoadventure.com\/the-beginner-guide-to-polygon-matic\/\"><u>Polygon blockchain<\/u><\/a> as a proof-of-stake (POS) token with 0.4% taxation and the DAO should issue it in the upcoming months. The token is CULT\u2019s first sibling. However, while CULT works to fund the protocols accelerating decentralization, RVLT aims to support the individual CULT DAO users (The Many) working towards the same goal.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/wearecultdao.medium.com\/emancipate-the-many-from-wage-slavery-rvlt-b43e6431d51e\"><u>recent blog<\/u><\/a>, Cult DAO founder Mr. O\u2019Modulus talks about the Revolt 2 Earn concept:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSociety is designed to make it as difficult as possible to break away from economic, societal, and social norms. So what if supporting the $CULT ecosystem could be in itself a full-time or part-time job?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This concept led him to develop a self-governing, autonomous ecosystem that would reward those who build and contribute on a large scale (The Guardians)\u00a0 as well as those who do so at a smaller, individual yet just as important level. The latter revolutionaries are the Many, and they can use RVLT for both staking and rewards.<\/p>\n<p>The Many are under direct government by the CULTmanders. These are RVLT stakers, and basically, every staker can be a CULTmander if they stake for a mid-long period.<\/p>\n<p>Each month, the protocol will randomly pick 490 stakers and 10 consistent NFT owners from all the RVLT stakers (uRVLT owners). These 500 members have to approve or disprove the users\u2019 action submissions supporting the \u201cCULT revolution.\u201d Their actions can include anything as simple as stickering, leafleting, shilling, or civil disobedience.<\/p>\n<p>This system ensures both level and individual rewards and could allow users to break away from the current centralized system. In other words, it enables them to revolt by talking about CULT and the CULT Manifesto to others.<\/p>\n<p>In\u00a0 the same blog, Mr. O\u2019Modulus says:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis protocol exists to allow The Many do not have to rely on wage labor fully, or in part and to fill the gap and pay users to further the cause of decentralization and the CULT ecosystem.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n!function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s){if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?\nn.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;\nn.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;\nt.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window,\ndocument,'script','https:\/\/connect.facebook.net\/en_US\/fbevents.js');\n<\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.the-blockchain.com\/2022\/05\/09\/cult-daos-revolt-2-earn-concept-draws-the-attention-of-anonymous\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Decentralized autonomous organization CULT DAO, is seeking to advance the decentralized finance revolution, announces Revolt (RVLT), which attracted the attention of Anonymous.
