However, the research says that Solana has lost 60% in total value locked since January first day of 2022, trapped inside a bear market pattern.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To be exact, on January 1st, Solana\u2019s TVL was approximately $11.22 billion, but by May 16, it had fallen to around $4.38 billion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Solana is a blockchain that helps create user-friendly applications that are very scalable. As the fastest growing ecosystem in the crypto finance space, Solana has thousands of projects under Web3, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and DeFi.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Reason Behind The Decline in Solana Total Value Locked<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This week, the Solana TVL reached new lows due to the number of decentralized applications (dApps) in its ecosystem plummeting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, the Tulip yield aggregation platform has shed more than 11% of its TVL in the last month.
