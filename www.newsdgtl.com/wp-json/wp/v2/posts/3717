The ongoing bearish trend has remarkable similarity with the previous mid-season bearish trend that lasted from May to June 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In both market crashes, Bitcoin\u2019s price broke the resistance level of $30,000. Recently, it had dropped more than it reversed back in June 2021 when the BTC\u2019s valuation stopped losing at $29,800. In contrast, its price in the current market clash has touched the $26,3000 level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/dogecoin\/dogecoin-has-dropped-90-since-the-dogefather-debuted-on-snl\/\">Dogecoin Has Dropped 90% Since \u201cThe Dogefather\u201d Debuted On SNL<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Several macroeconomic factors impacted the crypto market in both instances. For example, before 2021\u2019s bearish trend, Chinese banks prevented using crypto by disallowing crypto services for the state\u2019s financial sector. Then Elon Musk added fuel to the fire by reversing his decision to include Bitcoin for Tesla payments. Similarly, the distortion of COVID-19 caused some major countries to step back from the blockchain industry; thereby, the BTC price plummeted dramatically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Likewise, in the most recent downtrend, geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic facts have decided the fate of Bitcoin. First, the Russia-Ukraine conflict immensely affected the crypto price, with regulators imposing strict rules day by day at a time when Bitcoin is starting to grow worldwide. Then legal ambiguity and Fed regulation of digital assets further plunged back Bitcoin price.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_490451\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-490451\" style=\"width: 728px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-490451\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/BTCUSD_2022-05-13_17-23-46-1-860x430.png\" alt=\"BTCUSD\" width=\"728\" height=\"364\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-490451\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bitcoin price struggles to hold $30,000 again. | Source: BTC\/USD price chart from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/7kaJ1mts\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bitcoin Holders Rushed To Exit Their Assets<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Crypto investors have been withdrawing their holdings after the recent slump, and many still hold on to losses and expect crypto prices will rock on again in the future. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/glassnodealerts\/status\/1524573927250481152\">According to stats<\/a>, 16,967,726 wallet addresses currently took losses and broke previous records. Crypto history has seen a similar peak on 19 Mach 2020.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The unusual behavior of the crypto market compelled investors to liquidate their assets, neglecting the losses they had taken. That\u2019s why the figure for the following metric has decreased. Now, the number of crypto traders holdings 1K+ coins in their wallets has reached a low of 2,234, and most importantly, this figure was recorded on May 11.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Again, May 11 set a new record of transactions in the Bitcoin network as crypto holders rushed to exit their investments. It has reached a 4-year new high of traded volume with 175,146.8 BTC. The recent volume of committed transactions has eclipsed previous highs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/bitcoin-gains-momentum-30k\/\">TA: Bitcoin Gains Momentum, Why Break Above $30K Is Crucial<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Considering the present situation of the crypto market, the host of The Wolf of All Streets Podcast, Scott Melker, <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.thewolfofallstreets.io\/podcast\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">commented <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">that \u201cthe entire market is reeling.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He added:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think that markets are in a full irrational panic.
