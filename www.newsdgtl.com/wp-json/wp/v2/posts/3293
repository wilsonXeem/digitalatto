This is huge for Binance and the crypto market as a whole, especially during the times that the world has gone through these past years.

These two were often involved in debates, going back and forth with each other. Although sometimes they supported each other, there were several times when they disagreed. For instance, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/dogecoin-price-prediction-2022\/\">Dogecoin<\/a> users were having issues depositing and withdrawing DOGE from Binance, and Musk called CZ out publicly on Twitter.

Although <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin<\/a> tips are available, people want to be able to use other blockchains as well, including the famous Dogecoin.

As of right now, only users with Twitter Blue can use their NFTs as PFPs. And lastly, users want Musk to save them from bots, literally.
