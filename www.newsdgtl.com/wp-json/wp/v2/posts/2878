In the past week, the digital asset\u2019s market value fell by over 17%.<\/p>\n<p>The coin has been repeatedly facing rejection at the $0.700 level for a week, consistent rejection has caused the bears to take over the market.<\/p>\n<p>The bulls have been driven out of the market and so buyers also have existed from the market. With each rejection, XRP experienced a sell-off. Trading volume was also seen in red which is in accordance with the falling market cap of the coin.<\/p>\n<p>Immediate resistance for the coin was at $0.700 and then at $0.770. If prices plummet any further, the next support line for the coin awaited at $0.59, a level the coin last visited in the month of February 2022.<\/p>\n<h2>Technical Analysis<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_489332\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-489332\" style=\"width: 1791px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-489332 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/XRPUSD_2022-04-30_01-09-16.png\" alt=\"XRP\" width=\"1791\" height=\"761\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-489332\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">XRP has witnessed a fall in buying strength on the four-hour chart.
