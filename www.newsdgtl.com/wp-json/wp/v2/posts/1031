The most notable one is the addition of Apple Pay support as it allows users to buy crypto.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Apple does not support crypto payments directly from its platform, which seems to be an issue. In regard, there is only one way to make a transaction. This may be done using Wyre, a third-party service. It accepts crypto payments and connects with Apple Pay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moreover, there is no longer a need for users to rely on ETH transfers to fund their purchases. They can now buy crypto with debit or credit cards. Apple Pay users can put up to $400 into their wallets each day with their <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/visa.com\">Visa<\/a> or <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/mastercard.com\">MasterCard<\/a> and the Wyre API.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\ud83d\udce3 MetaMask Mobile v4.3.1 is LIVE with some exciting updates:<\/p>\n<p>Buy crypto on iOS with Apple Pay (<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sendwyre?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@sendwyre<\/a>), more transparency when interacting with sites, &amp; support for gasless transactions where relevant.<\/p>\n<p>Does it get any better?

Correspondingly, they can buy <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">crypto<\/a> with their credit or debit cards. Everyone can do this through the Transak payment system, which MetaMask uses. However, if you want to use either of these payment platforms, you must go through the KYC (know-your-customer) process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When you use MetaMask on layer-1, you also have to pay gas fees. Despite this fact, the company says it does not make money from them. Additionally, MetaMask also charges its own fees. These fees are 0.875% of the transaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As part of the updates, the support for free-gas transactions takes place. This means that private <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchains<\/a>, a project, or protocols could pay for the<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/gas-fees-meaning-what-are-gas-fees\/\"> gas fees<\/a> on the user\u2019s behalf.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As of March 15, it was reported that MetaMask had more than 30 million active users each month. This makes MetaMask one of the most widely used crypto-wallets today. Furthermore, there was news about ConsenSys, the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a> solutions business behind the wallet. As revealed, ConsenSys announced a $450 million financing round.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moreover, the CEO of ConsenSys, Joseph Lubin, relieved some important news. He noted that MetaMask is seeking to launch its own token and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-dao\/\">DAO<\/a>. However, there is not much information regarding the token. With that being said, users of MetaMask hope for a similar airdrop as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/uniswap-price-prediction\/\">Uniswap<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Attention to Fake Wallet Apps<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One of the most popular <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-wallet-definition\/\">crypto wallets<\/a>, MetaMask, continuously attracts hackers and frauds. Regarding this issue, ESET, a cybersecurity company, developed a sophisticated plan. The aim of this plan is to distribute fake wallet programs to Android and Apple devices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The analysis found that the developed scheme has been functional since May 2021. A scam wallet software for MetaMask, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/coinbase-review\/\">Coinbase<\/a>, Jaxx, and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/trust-wallet-review\/\">Trust Wallet<\/a> was very famous on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/facebook.com\">Facebook<\/a> groups. Their target is Chinese consumers. As a result, a few of them appeared on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/\">Google Play Store<\/a> too. However, within a short period of time, they were withdrawn in January.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\">\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/shibaswifecommunity\"><img src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" style=\"width:auto ;height:auto;\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/1648655624_677_ShibasWifeBannerGif3-1.gif\"\/><noscript><img src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/1648655624_677_ShibasWifeBannerGif3-1.gif\" style=\"width:auto ;height:auto;\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/iphone-users-using-applepay-for-crypto-in-metamask\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MetaMask released a few changes to its mobile version 4.3.1 on March 29.
