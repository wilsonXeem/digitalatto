Afterward, the volatile token skyrocketed and gained a whopping $720% in just 24 hours, reaching its value at $0.00040154. Likewise, Luna\u2019s trading volume surged 1000% after the TFL restarted its block production after a 9-hour halt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/ripple-xrp-price-picks-up\/\">Ripple (XRP) Price Picks Up As SEC Legal Showdown Drags On<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As things stand now, it\u2019s hard to speculate whether or not the Terra network can recover from such a huge loss.
