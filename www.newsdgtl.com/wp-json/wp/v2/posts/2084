This is still a long way from where the Luna Foundation plans for its reserves to be, making it a work in progress. In this report, we take a look at these reserve currencies and the portion allocated to each one.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Diving Into Terra\u2019s Reserves<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">As mentioned previously, Terra\u2019s crypto reserves have gone up to as high as $2.38 billion since it first <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/datastudio.google.com\/u\/0\/reporting\/b31cc9e5-c54c-4418-a6ce-b332c57e82e9\/page\/4YBqC?s=or-T7NeGLew\">announced<\/a> it was starting the reserves. Luna Foundation Guard has been putting more money into its Bitcoin reserves, which it plans to get to at least $10 billion in BTC with time. This makes the pioneer cryptocurrency the largest of the holdings in this regard. Although there are other cryptocurrencies that mark the lineup, bringing the total to four.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/cardano\/ada-to-rebound-with-integration-of-usdt-and-usdc-on-cardano\/\">ADA To Rebound With Integration Of USDT And USDC On Cardano?<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Following behind Bitcoin are the ERC-20 tokens which combined make up the second-largest percentage of the reserves at 23.2%. These are both stablecoins USDC and USDT, coming out to a total of $549.80 million of these tokens serving as reserves for USDT.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Additionally, Terra\u2019s native token, Luna, also makes the list of reserves used by the network.

This put Bitcoin in the large majority at 69.6% of all reserves, coming out to a total dollar value of $1.66 billion.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Where\u2019s AVAX?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Last week, it was <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinist.com\/terra-turns-to-avax-reserves\/\">announced<\/a> that Terra would add AVAX to its reserves as a way to combat the rising competition. This came as a result of a collaboration between Avalanche Foundation, Terraform Labs, and the Luna Foundation Guard who had said they would be purchasing about $200 million worth of AVAX to add to its reserves.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/crypto\/bitcoin-clings-to-40000\/\">Bitcoin Clings To $40K On Easter Sunday As Crypto Seen To Head Lower In The Short Term<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Do Kwon, founder of Terra, had explained that the decision to add AVAX to Terra\u2019s reserves had been fueled by the loyalty to the network. However, a look at LFG\u2019s reserves shows that there is no AVAX in sight. This could easily mean that the foundation is yet to add AVAX to its reserves.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">However, per the deal with Avalanche Foundation, both the Avalanche Foundation and Terraform Labs currently hold $100 million worth of AVAX each, while the Avalanche Foundation now holds $100 million worth of LUNA and $100 million worth of UST.<\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Featured image from CryptoSlate, chart from TradingView.com<\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/terra-luna\/inside-terras-2-38-billion-reserves-what-made-the-lineup\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Terra (LUNA) has been aggressive about filling up its reserves with trusted cryptocurrencies to serve as a backup for its stablecoin UST.
