Here, users will be able to claim their hard-earned rewards through an animated, haptic reveal experience, which they can then share with their friends from directly within the app.<\/p>\n<p>Although the app is exclusively available for iPhone users, there is also a cause for Android users to get excited, as Sorare have also announced that an Android beta is currently in development, with its roll-out set to take place sometime in the next few months.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
