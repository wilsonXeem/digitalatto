While PancakeSwap Exchange began as a copy of Uniswap on another blockchain, it has evolved into a far more popular platform than Uniswap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PancakeSwap has surpassed $100 million in daily <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/understanding-crypto-trading-volume\/\">trade volume<\/a> and is one of the most popular <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/dapp-meaning-what-are-dapps\/\">DApps<\/a> ever. In addition, it has surpassed <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-exchange\/\">Binance\u2019s<\/a> own Binance DEX as the most popular DEX on Binance Smart Chain in less than a year. But what exactly makes it so special, and what has caused it to be so successful?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What Is PancakeSwap?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As mentioned above, PancakeSwap is by far the most popular decentralized exchange on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-smart-chain-bsc\/\">Binance Smart Chain<\/a>. Clients may safely exchange <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-coin-price-prediction-2021\/\">Binance Coin (BNB)<\/a> and a wide range of BEP-20 coins without depending on centralized services. All transactions on PancakeSwap are handled via <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/smart-contracts\/\">smart contracts<\/a> as a decentralized exchange, eliminating the need for a middleman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The PancakeSwap smart contract code is open-source and everyone can read it. Despite this, the team is believed to include more than a dozen people, featuring two co-leads and a variety of software engineers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The platform first launched in September 2020; since then, it has witnessed a significant increase in the number of customers and the range of features it provides. PancakeSwap has grown into a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-decentralized-finance\/\">DeFi<\/a> ecosystem focused around CAKE, the platform\u2019s primary utility currency.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What Is CAKE?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CAKE is PancakeSwap\u2019s native token, and you can use it for many things in the expanding ecosystem. Yield farming, staking, partaking in the PancakeSwap Lottery, and voting on governance ideas through the platform\u2019s community governance site are the platform\u2019s key features.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How To Use PancakeSwap<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PancakeSwap calls itself AMM, which stands for Automated Market Maker, although that is just a more fancy way of saying exchange.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In a nutshell, a decentralized liquidity protocol such as PancakeSwap is used to create the foundation of liquidity for the platform\u2019s trading function. Users like you supply liquidity, so others may utilize the decentralized exchange to effortlessly transfer <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/token-meaning-what-is-a-cryptocurrency-token\/\">tokens<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As a result, PancakeSwap AMM takes the place of centralized order books like those found on other cryptocurrency exchanges. Users who wish to use PancakeSwap to swap cryptocurrencies or offer them in exchange for incentives would want this feature, thus making the platform achieve high numbers of users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Before you start using PancakeSwap, you\u2019ll need to know how to connect MetaMask to Binance Smart Chain. So before you start your journey on PancakeSwap, here\u2019s a little tutorial showing you just that.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PancakeSwap DEX<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To get started with PancakeSwap, first, you must hop onto <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/pancakeswap.finance\/\">pancakeswap.finance<\/a> and then click\u00a0<\/span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Trade\u00a0<\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">from the menu.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After clicking trade, you will get two options:\u00a0<\/span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Liquidity\u00a0<\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and<\/span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0Exchange.\u00a0<\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Next, toggle the tool in the center of your screen to the Swap option by clicking exchange.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You may now choose the exchange\u2019s inputs. Then, select the coins you wish to trade from the drop-down menus on each line. You trade crypto on PancakeSwap with user-generated AMM liquidity pools instead of an order book, making exchanges quicker, simpler, and more versatile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After choosing your preferred assets, click on the Swap button and then confirm the transaction in your <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-wallet-definition\/\">wallet<\/a>, and then you\u2019re finally finished!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Binance Bridge<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To trade ERC-20 tokens on PancakeSwap, you first need to wrap them on the Binance Bridge and convert them to BEP-20 assets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To do just that, go to the Binance Bridge and link your digital wallet there. Next, you\u2019ll need to verify the transaction on the Ethereum network, which will require an amount of Ether known as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/gas-fees-meaning-what-are-gas-fees\/\">gas fees<\/a>. This is assuming you\u2019re connected from a MetaMask wallet on the Ethereum blockchain, of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While this may be pricey due to high Ethereum gas fees, after you\u2019ve wrapped and bridged your crypto assets to BSC, PancakeSwap\u2019s low rates will save you a lot of trading fees. When you\u2019ve completed your transactions on PancakeSwap and wish to convert your BEP-20 assets back to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/erc-20-tokens-explained\/\">ERC-20<\/a>, simply use Binance Bridge to reverse the process. So, through this bridge, you can purchase tokens such as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/apecoin-price-prediction-2022\/\">ApeCoin<\/a> using BSC.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How To Provide Liquidity To PancakeSwap<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">On PancakeSwap, you may earn incentives by being a liquidity supplier. It\u2019s simple to do, and it maintains the AMM liquid for other exchange users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ensure your wallet is unlocked by clicking liquidity, then Add liquidity. Afterward, you\u2019ll need to select the tokens for which you\u2019re offering liquidity. Remember that on PancakeSwap, you must give two tokens to provide liquidity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Liquidity can be provided to either:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Existing Pools<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pools created by you<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">New projects that want to launch their cryptocurrency token frequently create their own pool. If that doesn\u2019t seem like you, the preferable choice is to provide liquidity to an already existing pool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Once you\u2019ve chosen the pair for which you\u2019ll provide liquidity, proceed to deposit by completing the transaction. You\u2019ll receive FLIP, an LP token that symbolizes your pool <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/pos-meaning-in-crypto-what-is-proof-of-stake\/\">stake<\/a> following your investment. When you possess the FLIP-LP token, you will get a percentage of the benefits from every exchange that dips into your pool\u2019s liquidity. Simply exchange your FLIP tokens to access the assets, which may have increased in value over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How To Yield Farm On PancakeSwap<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yield farming entails depositing one pair of tokens to create a new token.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Click the Farms tab to create a farm with PancakeSwap. To view what\u2019s happening, make sure you turn Live farms on. A broad list of possibilities, including several farms with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrencies<\/a> such as BUSD and BNB base pairs, should appear on the website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Select the farms that spark your attention, then go to the Information tab to check how much CAKE each farm generates. PancakeSwap\u2019s farming APY is currently quite high across several pairings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After clicking on Details, PancakeSwap will ask you to open your wallet before identifying the currencies within and letting you deposit them on the farm. The website will refresh with your CAKE earned after you\u2019ve deposited.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Playing the PancakeSwap Lottery<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One of PancakeSwaps prominent features is the PancakeSwap Lottery; it allows you to gamble using your CAKE tokens as a currency. Who knows? You might even get lucky and hit the jackpot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To do this, Click Lottery, then use CAKE coins to purchase lottery tickets. You have a higher chance of winning if you spend more CAKE. You earn a percentage of the entire CAKE prize if you strike two or more of the winning numbers on your tickets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0Lottery sessions take place numerous times a day, roughly every six hours. This maintains a high turnover rate and increases your chances of you being lucky.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Is PancakeSwap Better Than Uniswap?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The short answer is no, although it is more complicated than just that. On the other hand, PancakeSwap has more liquidity making it a popular and decent decentralized exchange.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24025\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"&quot;Uniswap\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/PRICE-PREDICTIONS-FEATURED-IMAGE-TEMPLATE-3-1.png\"\/><\/p>\n<p><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24025\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/PRICE-PREDICTIONS-FEATURED-IMAGE-TEMPLATE-3-1.png\" alt=\"&quot;Uniswap\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We can\u2019t truly label PancakeSwap a real decentralized exchange because it operates on Binance Smart Chain, which isn\u2019t completely decentralized. However, a certain level of centralization has some advantages.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PancakeSwap, for example, is significantly quicker and less expensive to use than Uniswap, with an equal degree of liquidity. But, most importantly, if you want to trade ERC-20 tokens, you\u2019ll have to use the Binance Bridge to move funds in and out of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a>, which may be very costly for certain people depending on gas prices in their area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0As a result, people who already own BEP-20 tokens and want to retain their transactions on Binance Smart Chain will have the greatest experience with PancakeSwap. It\u2019s not difficult, though, given BSC\u2019s current expansion rate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What Makes PancakeSwap Unique?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PancakeSwap, which is based on Binance Smart Chain, uses a number of its features to provide a better trading experience to its consumers. For example, it has very cheap transaction costs and short verification times, guaranteeing that deals are completed swiftly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PancakeSwap also has many auxiliary features, many of which are useful to CAKE holders (<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/hodlers-meaning\/\">HODLers<\/a>). Nowadays, the most notable of them are Yield Farms, Syrup Farms, Lottery v2, NFT Collectibles, Prediction Markets, and Initial Farm Offerings. Some of these we have mentioned above; here is some insight on the ones we didn\u2019t mention.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Syrup Pools<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Syrup pools replace the simple staking mechanism of PancakeSwap. Instead, customer tokens may be staked in the Syrup pools of the platform to receive a return, which can be in CAKE or other cryptocurrency tokens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The APY for every pool might change significantly, similar to its yield farms, and users must include in the fluctuating value of their staked assets while calculating their return.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Prediction Markets<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The prediction market feature on PancakeSwap allows users to forecast if the value of BNB will increase or decrease in the next five minutes. Users pool their money into a reward pool, split among those who accurately anticipate the market\u2019s future. The bet sum is forfeited by the losers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">NFT Collectibles<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PancakeSwap introduced NFT Profiles in February 2021, allowing customers to select an NFT profile photo after obtaining one of the various Bunny NFTs. Users that fill up their profiles completely will be able to join a team and engage in special team activities to gain prizes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"657\" height=\"370\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24026\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"&quot;&lt;yoastmark\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/12e3072b07eb4bcebbb8bc4baa9ee5f8.png\"\/><\/p>\n<p><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"657\" height=\"370\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24026\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/12e3072b07eb4bcebbb8bc4baa9ee5f8.png\" alt=\"&quot;&lt;yoastmark\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Is PancakeSwap Safe?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Especially when compared to other DeFi yield farming platforms, PancakeSwap provides a better level of security. If you\u2019re wondering how safe this DEX is, note that it has a significantly better level of security than other <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-decentralized-finance\/\">DeFi<\/a> protocols.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What Is The Difference Between Staking And Farming?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Joining PancakeSwap allows you to earn more CAKE by staking in Syrup Pools and farming using Yield Farming. To earn CAKE or other tokens through staking, simply contribute some CAKE to a Syrup Pool. While on the other hand, farming is more difficult and requires LP Tokens to earn CAKE.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What\u2019s The Best Wallet For PancakeSwap?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We have mentioned <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/metamask-review\/\">MetaMask<\/a> above due to convenience, but choosing the best digital wallet for PancakeSwap is completely up to the user. Some wallets offer more features than others, and the best wallet is the one the user feels the most comfortable using.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What Is The Maximum Supply Of CAKE?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CAKE does not have a maximum supply cap.
