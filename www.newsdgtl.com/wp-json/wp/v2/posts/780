Several fascinating cryptocurrencies have joined the market recently. At the time of writing, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-nft-non-fungible-tokens\/\">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)<\/a> have the attention of hundreds of investors. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bored-ape-yacht-club-price-prediction-2022\/\">The Bored Ape Yacht Club<\/a> and its related collections are the most popular NFTs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This collection consists of apes that express boredom. As a result, these ordinary-looking works of art attracted several investors. Moreover, the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/apecoin-price-prediction-2022\/\">Apecoin (APE)<\/a> is the cryptocurrency of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, which has exploded in terms of popularity recently.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is ApeCoin (APE)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The BAYC, a Yuga Labs NFT project with 10,000 unique <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bored-apes-price\/\">Bored Apes<\/a>, uses ApeCoin as its governance and utility currency. The ApeCoin DAO oversees and manages the Ape Foundation, which runs ApeCoin. Its goal is to ensure governance as the community grows. As a result, ApeCoin holders became <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-dao\/\">DAO<\/a> voters, with the Foundation serving as a facilitator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">ApeCoin is an open-source initiative that serves the Web 3.0 economy, in which the creators of online-based material are also the owners. Digital artwork, music, videos, GIFs, in-game items, and so on are all included.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The potential for <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchain\u2019s<\/a> cultural effect is so wide that it. APE is a built-on, community-controlled <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/token-meaning-what-is-a-cryptocurrency-token\/\">token<\/a> meant to support whatever will be next. Furthermore, ApeCoin will function as a decentralized protocol layer for community-led activities in the Metaverse, focused on developing culture.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Objectives<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The ApeCoin Project aims to encourage the formation and growth of a web-based, decentralized <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-web3\/\">Web 3.0<\/a> community by enabling the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Governance:<\/strong> <\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As members of the ApeCoin DAO, ApeCoin users are responsible for voting on proposed protocol notifications and ensuring that the project\u2019s long-term goal is maintained.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Access:<\/em> <\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Certain aspects of the APE ecosystem, such as exclusive merchandise, games, services, and even events, are restricted to day-to-day users.

Thus, it unites the whole community and allows them to deal amongst themselves on a decentralized platform.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How To Buy ApeCoin (APE)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The top exchanges for trading in ApeCoin stock are Binance, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.okx.com\/\">OKX<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bybit-review\/\">Bybit<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/kraken-review-2021\/\">Kraken<\/a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/coinbase-review\/\">Coinbase<\/a>. Additionally, its market pairs include BUSD, USDT, BTC, and ETH. Below, we will show you how to buy ApeCoin.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Step 1: Create an Exchange Account<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The first step towards purchasing an ApeCoin token is creating an account on a centralized exchange. For this step, we suggest using Binance since it offers the most liquidity for BTC and BUSD. However, if you want to create an account on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-exchange\/\">Binance<\/a>, you need to provide a considerable amount of information.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To begin trading in Binance, you need to provide an email address, phone number, and a strong password. After opening your account, you will need to verify your account. Account verification is done by providing your ID document, passport, driving license, or residence permit.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24019\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24019\" style=\"width: 1902px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24019\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Creating Binance Account to Buy ApeCoin\" width=\"800\" height=\"395\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/binance-1.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24019\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/binance-1.png\" alt=\"Creating Binance Account to Buy ApeCoin\" width=\"800\" height=\"395\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24019\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>First Step of How to Buy ApeCoin Guide.

Funding a centralized <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-exchange\/\">exchange<\/a> account is very easy and you can do it in various ways. Some of the ways you can fund your account on Binance are using credit\/debit cards and bank transfers. Thus, Binance allows you to deposit fiat money into your account and purchase crypto directly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Before you trade cryptocurrencies, you need to buy them first. Binance offers Peer-to-Peer (P2P) services where you can buy USDT, BUSD, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">ETH<\/a>, or <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">BTC<\/a> using fiat currencies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you want to buy from the P2P platform, follow these steps:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Click Buy Crypto \u2013 P2P Trading<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Choose your market pair\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Buy directly from other users<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, the easiest way to fund your Binance is by using your credit\/debit card.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24020\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24020\" style=\"width: 1891px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24020\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Funding Your Binance to Buy ApeCoin\" width=\"800\" height=\"395\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/binance-2.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24020\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/binance-2.png\" alt=\"Funding Your Binance to Buy ApeCoin\" width=\"800\" height=\"395\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24020\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Second Step on How to Buy ApeCoin Guide.

If you want to purchase with a credit\/debit card, simply put the amount you want to spend in your chosen currency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can also deposit fiat money and directly purchase APE. The deposit may take up to 2 business days. However, it has no transaction fee and it often executes within minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Now that you have finished the process of purchasing APE, you are officially an ApeCoin holder (<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/hodlers-meaning\/\">HODLer<\/a>). Before <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/investing-vs-trading-crypto\/\">investing<\/a>, however, please do your own research.
