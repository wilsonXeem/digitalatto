The market for this coin quickly melted down within four days. As a result, the stablecoin lost $18 billion. This affected not only the stablecoin UST but also all networks built upon it, such as LUNA, whose price plummetted from $62 per coin down to a fraction of a penny.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_491005\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-491005\" style=\"width: 596px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-491005\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/LUNAUSD_2022-05-20_20-20-55-460x270.png\" alt=\"LUNA price chart\" width=\"596\" height=\"350\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-491005\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">LUNA is currently trading at $0.00013 with a 1% increase | Source: LUNA\/USD price chart from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/?symbol=BITSTAMP%3ABTCUSD\">Tradingview.com<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Tax Authorities Fined LUNA Founder For Avoiding Taxes<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In order to investigate, both South Korean regulatory bodies, the Financial Supervisory Service and the Financial Services Commission called the local cryptocurrency exchanges to submit the transactions data.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The information requested from the local exchanges includes trade volumes for LUNA and UST as well the number of investors who have suffered losses because their investments declined during this time period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On the data request, a local exchange operator, Yonhap, said;<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It seems that they collected this information in order to minimize damage to investors in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Korean National Tax Service has found that Terra\u2019s parent firms have avoided paying corporate and income taxes.

However, the two men declined since their company, Terraform Labs, is domiciled in Singapore. The NTS argues that all of Terraform Lab\u2019s operations are controlled from South Korea, but the two men maintain that their business is conducted primarily in Singapore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/tether-cuts-17-of-its-commercial-paper-holdings-over-q1-2022\/\">Tether Cuts 17% Of Its Commercial Paper Holdings Over Q1 2022<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition, only a few days before Terra collapsed, Do Kwon attempted to dissolve Terra\u2019s Korean entities.
