This was announced on Wednesday in a blog post from the<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-exchange\/\"> crypto exchange<\/a>. Coinbase\u2019s vice president of product and ecosystem, Sanchan Saxena added some key design points. He noted that the design of the marketplace would be a mix of social media platforms and other NFT marketplaces, like <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/opensea.io\">OpeaSea<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A Community of the Ecosystem<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In addition to buying and selling NFTs, Saxena said there is more. He realized from talking to many customers and creators that there is more to the ecosystem. In regard, Saxena said that this launch has a community aspect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moreover, Saxena claims the platform will allow user and artist interaction. To discover new NFTs, users can follow creators, comment on artwork or use a tailored feed to discover new NFTs based on engagement and sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Regarding comment moderation, Saxena stated that users and legislators decide the law of the land. But, as a Coinbase official revealed, they are not in the business of evaluating what is moral or wrong as long as it is legal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">During the beta version development, the exchange noted there would be no transaction fees for a particular time. In addition, a partnership with 0x Labs will help cut <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/gas-fees-meaning-what-are-gas-fees\/\">gas<\/a> expenses for<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\"> Ethereum (ETH)<\/a> transactions. Meanwhile, choices for wallets include self-custody or Coinbase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As stated by Coinbase, the NFT marketplace will be available to all users above the age of 18. It also stated that it aimed to decentralize more features such as user comments.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Wen Coinbase NFT?

Furthermore, it had more than 89 million verified users who traded $547 billion worth of crypto in the last three months. Correspondingly, if the exchange\u2019s liquidity spreads to its NFT project, that would be a big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In the crypto world, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/coinbase-review\/\">Coinbase<\/a> is one of a few exchanges trying to get in on the sale of NFTs. Also, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-exchange\/\">Binance<\/a> started selling NFTs in June 2021. Finally, in September, FTX and its U.S. arm started selling NFTs on the Solana and Ethereum blockchains, so people could trade them between them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The data from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dappradar.com\/\">DappRadar<\/a> shows that, in terms of NFT marketplaces, OpenSea is on top. It came out with about $130 million worth of transactions in a day. Nonetheless, the recent sales of an NFT of Jack Dorsey\u2019s first tweet show that the market may be slowing down. In 2021, a user bought the tokenized image for $2.9 million, while the highest bid at the time was about $32,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/coinbase-launches-nft-marketplace\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the coming weeks, Coinbase NFT, the new Coinbase marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will be available to all users above 18.
