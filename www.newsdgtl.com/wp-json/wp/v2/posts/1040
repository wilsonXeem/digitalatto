A welcome change after the digital asset had spent a long stretch of time plagued by low momentum. It officially signaled a break out of the consolidation of the past two-and-a-half months. Now the real work begins as bears have begun mounting significant resistance to keep the cryptocurrency from breaking above $50,000.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">The Point To Beat<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Although Bitcoin continues to hold above $47,000, there is still a lot of opposition to the digital asset in this region. $47,500 remains a technical level that has shown itself throughout various rallies in history. This time around, bears are camping at this technical level, making it a significant resistance to point to beat. Otherwise, the goal of $50,000 will remain unrealized.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/small-cap-altcoins-beat-bitcoin-and-other-crypto-assets-10-to-1-but-why\/\">Small Cap Altcoins Beat Bitcoin And Other Crypto Assets 10 To 1, But Why?<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">If the digital asset is able to successfully beat this point and form support above it, then there will be not much opposition in the race to $50,000 as the next important point will lie above this level. A push past $50,000 would set the cryptocurrency on another path towards $53,000.

BTC continues to hold strong at this point though.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Bitcoin Holding Up Well<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Even though bitcoin had taken a beat-down after testing the $47,500 resistance point, it has quickly found its footing. One important thing to note is where the digital asset looks to have formed an important support level.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/QRW9j9W2\/\" alt=\"Bitcoin price chart from TradingView.com\" width=\"1354\" height=\"686\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC fails to beat $47,500 resistance level | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/tradingview.com\">BTCUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p class=\"p2\">Arcane Research notes that BTC looks to have flipped $45,000, which was the resistance to beat in the early innings of the rally, into a support level. This means a slide below $47,000 may see the digital asset fall below $46,000 but will most likely find significant support at this $45K level. Although a fall below this will quickly send BTC back to the low $42,000s given it is more akin to a sliding scale.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/eth\/ethereum-losing-pace-3400\/\">TA: Ethereum Losing Pace, What Could Trigger Another Increase<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Bitcoin is now comfortably trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving average, cementing both a short and long-term bullish outlook for the asset.
