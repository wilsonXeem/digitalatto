In addition, they claim that Uniswap\u2019s lack of a Know Your Customer (KYC) policy has enabled alleged cases of fraud without the DEX taking measures to prevent these supposed activities.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, the plaintiff claims the DEX and the defenders have benefited from \u201cundisclosed fees\u201d collected on \u201cevery transaction\u201d executed with the platform in an alleged violation of the U.S. Securities laws, according to the document. The plaintiffs also accused the platform of selling scam tokens.<\/p>\n<p>These include Rocket Bunny, BoomBaby.io, Matrix Samurai, EthereumMax, and others. The plaintiffs claimed these tokens failed to file a registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).<\/p>\n<p>Uniswap is a decentralized exchange running on Ethereum and operating under a governance model controlled by UNI holders. Unlike centralized exchange it is permissionless, and its smart contracts respond to no centralized authorities for the benefit or detriment of any party.<\/p>\n<p>According to the document filed with the court, Risley and the other plaintiffs were not familiar with Uniswap. At least, the document suggests they have little experience trading on the platform before incurring alleged \u201csubstantial losses\u201d which led to their lawsuit.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Uniswap lawsuit has me rolling.<\/p>\n<p>She needed consistent disclosures to figure out that &#8220;Rocket Bunny Token&#8221; and &#8220;BoomBaby&#8221; and &#8220;Matrix Samurai&#8221; were not legitimate, sensible investments.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/N1qq8uoZnz\">pic.twitter.com\/N1qq8uoZnz<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Cobie (@cobie) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cobie\/status\/1514470929400705025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 14, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Uniswap Releases New Product<\/h2>\n<p>Less than 24 hours after the class action was filed, Uniswap Labs launch a Swap Widget feature to allow users to \u201cseamlessly swap tokens anywhere across the web\u201d.
