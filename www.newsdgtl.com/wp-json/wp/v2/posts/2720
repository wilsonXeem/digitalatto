Here\u2019s What They\u2019re Buying<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the hype surrounding Elon Musk\u2019s purchase of Twitter faded, the cryptocurrency market and wider global financial markets fell under pressure on April 26. This caused people to become concerned about the state of the global economy again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The recent fall in cryptocurrency prices was matched by the sharp losses sustained among tech stocks. On April 26, tech-related stock asset Nasdaq lost 4% of its value, hitting a new low of 2022.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to TradingView, Bitcoin (BTC) held support at $40,500 through the early trading hours on April 26. However, in afternoon trading, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped 6.21% to hit a low of $38,009.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_489074\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-489074\" style=\"width: 601px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-489074\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/BTCUSD_2022-04-27_21-25-16-460x270.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin Price Chart\" width=\"601\" height=\"353\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-489074\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bitcoin moves upward after touching the $38,000 level | Source: BTC\/USD chart from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\">Tradingview.com<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The decline on April 26 is the continuation of the weakness of financial markets. The stock market has been on a decline this month. The S&amp;P 500 is down 7%. The Nasdaq declined 11%, and the Dow is nursing a 3% loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The downturn in Faang Stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) has dragged the wider market down. The recent 35% reduction in the price of Netflix on April 20 highlighted a major problem with the \u201cstrong markets\u201d statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Bitcoin May Test Macro Range Low<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bitcoin\u2019s price drop on April 26 has made some analysts think that we are headed for a bottom in the market, but not everyone agrees. For example, crypto analyst Rekt Capital says that the price may test a significant support zone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rekt Capital <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rektcapital\/status\/1519006486625665025\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">tweeted<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">;<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">BTC is right back at the long-standing macro Higher Low support.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, the analyst says that Bitcoin is still trading within the range it has been stuck in since the beginning of the year. Therefore, there is still a lot of support in the lower $30,000 range.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Related Reading |<\/em> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/dogecoin-doge-struggles-drops-9\/\">Dogecoin (DOGE) Struggles, Drops 9% After Elon Musk Twitter Buyout<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The DXY, a measure of the US dollar\u2019s performance against other global currencies, is currently at its highest price in two years.
