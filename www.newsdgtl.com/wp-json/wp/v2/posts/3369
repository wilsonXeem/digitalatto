Let\u2019s take a look at<\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-size: 1.953em;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\">The Fundamentals: Solana\u2019s NFT Status<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Solana has had it\u2019s fair share of critics in recent years \u2013 the chain has had periods of intermittent downtime, and it is often criticized as carrying more centralized qualities relative to comparable and competing chains. The objective of this write-up isn\u2019t to evaluate the nature of the chain, but rather to hone in on one of the biggest NFT projects in the ecosystem. We\u2019ll leave a deep dive of Solana\u2019s blockchain structure for another day, because one thing leaves little questioning \u2013 Solana was an early mover in being an Ethereum competitor that offered an NFT ecosystem with affordable gas prices.<\/p>\n<p>At current standing, the hot trending topic in Solana NFTs is undoubtedly Okay Bears \u2013 a newer PFP NFT project that has gained traction as the Solana ecosystem has grown.<\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-size: 1.953em;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\">DeGods: Current Standing<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>DeGods have far and away the highest floor price in the Solana NFT ecosystem, consistently commanding north of 200 SOL while routinely maintaining a top 5 position in daily volume. The 10,000 mint project has a market cap that encompasses nearly 20% of the total Solana NFT market cap, according to data from Solana NFT aggregator <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/hyperspace.xyz\/leaderboard\">Hyperspace<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>DeGods has a bit more of a \u2018legacy\u2019 standing in the Solana ecosystem, but as with any early mover, it can be difficult to maintain the standing as challengers emerge. The biggest challenger in recent weeks has undoubtedly been Okay Bears, which have been the face of Solana on communities like NFT Twitter, and has blown away Solana volume over the past week with over $40M worth of Okay Bears being bought and sold. DeGods certainly have a higher ceiling, but having less than 10% of that volume over the same timeframe suggests that Okay Bears could be gunning for the top spot as the Solana landscape continues to grow.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-490024 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Screen-Shot-2022-05-08-at-8.16.57-PM-460x252.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"675\" height=\"370\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Solana (SOL) doesn't have the legacy standing in NFTs that Ethereum has, but the blockchain has seemingly secured the #2 spot when it comes to NFT communities. | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/?symbol=FTX%3ASOLUSD\">SOL-USD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/tron-is-trading-within-its-triangle-pattern-what-awaits-the-coin-next\/\">Tron Is Trading Within It\u2019s Triangle Pattern; What Awaits The Coin Next?<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-size: 1.953em;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\">Recent Buzz: A Major Acquisition<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>What is DeGods doing to cement it\u2019s positioning as a Solana \u2018blue chip\u2019? It\u2019s easier said than done, but the DeGods community recently made a splash and made some headlines by dishing out roughly $625,000 for a team acquisition in Ice Cube\u2019s \u2018BIG3\u2019 basketball league. The league brings 3\u00d73 half-court basketball with a twist, and has consistently hosted ex-NBA athletes and ex-college stars (some of which have even returned to the NBA floor after appearing for the BIG3, a la Joe Johnson).<\/p>\n<p>DeGods purchased 25 NFTs of the BIG3\u2019s \u2018Killer 3s\u2019 team at $25,000 a piece, in a decision made by the NFT community\u2019s DAO late last month. Almost equally impactful could be the moves that follow suit. Announced over the weekend was a similar move from music mogul (and well-known crypto fan) Snoop Dogg, who teamed up with PayPal co-founder Ken Howery to purchase 25 NFTs of their own, this team for the league team \u2018Bivouac.\u2019 This sponsorship model from the BIG3 is especially unique, and the league has opened up it\u2019s own Ownership Model <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BIG3Ownership?s=20&amp;t=ctoYuoDgLIb1UCAnbEHifw\">Twitter page<\/a>, as well as a dedicated whitepaper outlining how the sponsorship model operates. Crypto and blockchain technology is running rampant through the BIG3 and DeGods can safely consider themselves \u2018early.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s plenty more on the horizon for DeGods as well. In a recent \u2018<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DeGodsNFT\/status\/1523148331920154624?s=20&amp;t=2yUWGJHrRuLKz61HIRC5Gg\">State of the Union<\/a>\u2018 address, the team addressed a native token (and some of the comments of skepticism around it), events, and a dedicated clip around the logic behind the DAO purchasing the BIG3 team.<\/p>\n<p>Little is certain in the NFT landscape, but DeGods is seemingly well-positioned to be a Solana staple with it\u2019s current engaged community and active, aggressive approach.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong style=\"font-style: italic\">Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/ape\/ape-takes-a-beating\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">APE Takes A Beating As It Sheds 50% Of It\u2019s Price<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"entry-content no-share\">\n<div class=\"content-inner \">\n<pre>Featured image from degods.com, Charts from TradingView.com&#13;\nThe writer of this content is not associated or affiliated with any of the parties mentioned in this article.
