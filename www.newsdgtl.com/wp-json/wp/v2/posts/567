Also pegged to USD in value, also transferable over Ethereum 24\/7.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>Wrapped Assets<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Wrapped assets bridge the gap between siloed systems resulting in more flexibility. They also enable networks with little or no DeFi infrastructure to enter larger DeFi venues like Ethereum or Solana.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WXRP<\/strong> \u2013 Wrapped XRP is XRP wrapped for use on Ethereum DeFi platforms. It is transferable to Ethereum and back for liquidity and arbitrage opportunities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>GateHub\u2019s assets on the XRPL have supported this use case for BTC, ETH, DASH, USD, and EUR since GateHub\u2019s inception.
