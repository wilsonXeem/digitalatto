In following the simple branding of Coinbase\u2019s new NFT marketplace, the platform will be dubbed \u2018Kraken NFT,\u2019 with perhaps its standout feature being its omission of gas fees for trades done on it.<\/p>\n<p>According to the exchange, the <strong>absence of gas fees<\/strong> means that NFT collectors will be able to build their collections without having to worry about network spikes impacting the cost of purchases. Other quirks of the platform include features such as a \u2018Creator Earnings\u2019 system which will allow artists and innovators to be paid each time an NFT creation of theirs is sold on secondary markets, an NFT rarity score tracker which will help users quantify the traits and attributes of their unique NFTs, and an industry leading security infrastructure that has been consistently fine-tuned for over 10 years.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Buyers and sellers will also be able to buy\/list NFTs in 6 of the most prevalent fiat currencies (USD, EUR, CAD, GBP, CHF and AUD), as well as in any of the <strong>120+ cryptocurrencies<\/strong> the platform will support. Kraken NFT also wishes to adopt a similar, all-encompassing stance with regards to what type of NFTs it will support, however at launch, only the Ethereum and Solana blockchains will be supported.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Despite these insights (as well as the news included in the platform\u2019s <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nftplazas.com\/kraken-nft-loans-marketplace\/\">initial announcement<\/a>) a launch date for Kraken NFT is still TBA. Although, in any context, an unconfirmed launch date doesn\u2019t necessarily bring excitement to the eyes of the onlooker, given Coinbase NFTs surprise Beta <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nftplazas.com\/coinbase-launch-beta-of-its-social-oriented-nft-marketplace\/\">launch<\/a>, as well as the genesis of the project\u2019s waitlist, Kraken NFT might not be as far away as we think.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
