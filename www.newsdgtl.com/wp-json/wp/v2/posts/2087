A majority of operators seem to be optimistic.<\/p>\n<p>As seen below, the long to short ratio on crypto exchange Binance stands at 2.88, meaning traders are dominantly long. Around 74% of the traders on this platform took long positions as opposed to 25%.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_488314\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-488314\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-488314 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSD-2-860x459.jpg\" alt=\"Bitcoin BTC BTCUSD\" width=\"860\" height=\"459\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-488314\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Ali Martinez via Twitter<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>In that sense, Martinez advised traders to stay cautious as Bitcoin rarely does what the majority expects.

Breaching this support level could see $BTC fall to $32,853 or even $26,820.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Data from Material Indicators (MI) supports these potential levels. As seen below, the price of Bitcoin bounced off a stack of bid orders (in yellow below the price) set at around $39,000.<\/p>\n<p>The benchmark crypto then proceeded to move upwards, but with little support at its current levels in case of a fresh increase in selling pressure until $38,000. Similar to when BTC saw support at $39,000, there are around $10 million in bid orders at those levels.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_488316\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-488316\" style=\"width: 861px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-488316 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSD-7.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin BTC BTCUSD\" width=\"861\" height=\"375\"  \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-488316\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">BTC\u2019s price (blue on the chart) bounces off support (bids in red and yellow below the price).

A capitulation event, a price action that moves the price out of the range, seems to be brewing.<\/p>\n<p>Additional data from Martinez records an important decrease in the supply of BTC sitting on exchange platforms. This metric stands at a one-year low with a persistent trend to the downside.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the supply crunch, the price of Bitcoin seems more tied to macro-economic factors. The increase in interest rates from the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) and the war between Russia and Ukraine are among the most important.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/bitcoin-100-sma-is-the-key-41500\/\">TA: Bitcoin Remains at Risk, Why 100 SMA Is The Key<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As NewsBTC reported, if the FED turns aggressive on its monetary policy, BTC\u2019s price could retest the bottom of its range or trend lower.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-traders-long-the-39k-dip-will-btc-head-in-expected-direction\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rejected once again as it attempted to reclaim the $40,000 area, Bitcoin trades just north of $39,000.
