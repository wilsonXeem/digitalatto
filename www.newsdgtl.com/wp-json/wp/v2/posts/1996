At least, this was the case throughout the past 50 years of video gaming. However, a new generation of video games is emerging. This generation uses <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchain<\/a> technologies like<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-nft-non-fungible-tokens\/\"> non-fungible tokens (NFTs)<\/a> to reward gamers with cryptocurrencies. These games, also known as \u201cplay-to-earn\u201d (P2E), have recently become popular. But w<\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">hat exactly are P2E games, and which ones are the most popular?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is Play-to-Earn (P2E)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Play-to-Earn (P2E) crypto games involve earning crypto through playing games. You make in-game currency by completing missions, winning battles, or completing other challenges. Usually, you can trade this in-game currency for <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a> or other tokens through a decentralized exchange.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The money earned by playing these games comes in the form of crypto. This means that you can use it to trade or just <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/hodlers-meaning\/\">HODL<\/a> onto it. In addition, they can also be used to acquire NFTs. In certain circumstances, NFTs are the in-game currency. This indicates that users can possess in-game items and sell or exchange them for something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Because the financial rewards of these games are a substantial incentive for players, the P2E sector is thriving. These activities are part of the GameFi movement, which blends gaming with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-decentralized-finance\/\">decentralized finance (DeFi)<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">GameFi<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">GameFi, known as \u201cplay-to-earn,\u201d combines gaming with blockchain-powered financialization. Such games allow users to gain digital assets for their in-game activities through missions, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/investing-vs-trading-crypto\/\">trade<\/a>, and other means. While traditional games allow players to accumulate and exchange digital assets, their investment is still a property of the game itself. GameFi games, on the other hand, maintain their assets dispersed throughout a network. As a result, these operate independently of any single organization, significantly reducing the risk of digital assets.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Top Play-to-Earn Games\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Axie Infinity<\/span><\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24797\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24797\" style=\"width: 1920px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-24797\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Play to Earn Game Axie Infinity\" width=\"800\" height=\"420\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/3940823e806bdd1f2100f299ef0466fe.jpg\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-24797\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/3940823e806bdd1f2100f299ef0466fe.jpg\" alt=\"Play to Earn Game Axie Infinity\" width=\"800\" height=\"420\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24797\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Axie Infinity Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game.
