Meet the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/themysticnft\">The Mystic<\/a>, an absolute glowing star in the world of art, and certainly one of my favorite latest artists.<\/p>\n<p>I was lucky to come across her art whilst doing my usual Twitter scrolling, and I immediately knew I just\u00a0<em>have\u00a0<\/em>to interview this incredible artist and get to know more about her art and NFT journey. I think her name, The Mystic, says it all. Her art is mystical, feminine, magical, gentle, and uplifting.<\/p>\n<p>So let\u2019s dive in and find out more about her NFT art and her experience in Web3 so far!<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\"><strong>How did you find out about the NFT space and what attracted you to create your own NFTs?<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>I was literally breastfeeding my newborn daughter one night in bed and read an article about NFTs. I was already looking for a creative outlet because my once creative job in the digital space was becoming mundane. As soon as I understood the concept of NFTs I fell in love, to me it\u2019s the future of art.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How often do you create?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Whenever I get the chance! Once the baby goes to sleep I sometimes find myself drawing for hours. The creative process is so relaxing and soothing to me.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38839 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/mystic6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1066\" height=\"932\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What is your creative process?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I usually have a general idea of a subject, then I pull a color palette together with my Pantone chips. From there, I pull some inspiration from vintage Moroccan textiles. Once I start drawing, I completely zone out. To me it\u2019s an outlet. When I create I zone out, I clear out all my anxieties and I feel like you can see it with some of the intense patterns I use.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38838 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/mystic5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"934\" height=\"932\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Are there any CryptoArtists you would love to collaborate with?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There are so many amazing artists in the space it\u2019s really hard to chose! I would really love to create some of my patterns into textiles IRL, so collaborating with a major fashion brand would be a dream!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38836 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/mystic3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"923\" height=\"920\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What do you think the future of CryptoArt will look like?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I truly believe NFTs are the future of art. I think curation will also be a huge component. It has already started, but I could see NFTs being more prominent in\u00a0advertising, retail, marketing and art galleries. NFTs are truly having a moment in art history, where more artists than ever before can get their work out there to be seen and provide a path to financial success in the art world.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38834 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/mystic1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"932\" height=\"935\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What are you currently working on?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I am currently finishing up my \u2730 IN THE ELEMENTS \u2730 collection. It\u2019s made up of 20 mystic women and their connection to natural forces. It\u2019s my first editions style collection which I have loved because it has given me a chance to open my collector base at a much more affordable price point.
