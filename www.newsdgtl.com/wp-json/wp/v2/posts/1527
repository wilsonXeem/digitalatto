Part of a \u201cbroader risk-off move\u201d, the announcement affected several sectors across the macro markets.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin\u2019s recent weeks relief rally was triggered by the FED as well. Investors were expecting an increase in interest rates at around 25 bps. The financial institution announced this increase back in March meeting expectations.<\/p>\n<p>This provided more clarity to market participants. However, the FED turned more aggressive on its approach as a result of a persistent inflation.<\/p>\n<p>In that sense, the financial institution has forced market participants to adjust their views potentially shaking speculators from their positions. Cumberland said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At this point, one has to wonder whether the Brainard\/FOMC commentary which triggered this move represents new &amp; meaningful information that should be factored into the market in the form of lower prices, or if instead this selloff is really just a classic case of weak hands rushing for the exits in a crowded trade.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The investment firm believes the second option is more likely. Therefore, they claimed the current downside price action could offer long-term traders with a buy the dip opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>At these levels, as Bitcoin moves in a tight range between $48,000 and $37,000, without new macro-factors to oppose a rally, the market could offer a high reward\/low risk scenario. The investment firm added:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(\u2026) If we approach those lows in the absence of a fresh geopolitical catastrophe, risk\/reward associated with adding more length seems attractive.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>The Macro Outlook And Its Potential Impact On Bitcoin<\/h2>\n<p>A Senior Economist at Natixis, a global financial services company, claimed the FED has accelerated its monetary tightening.
