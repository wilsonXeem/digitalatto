More specifically, the film will follow protagonist <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/anders_hofman\">Anders Hofman<\/a> (a.k.a. The Iceman), as he completes a 3.9km ice water swim, a 180k bike on a glacier, and a 42.2km run in a snow blizzard, and will aptly be titled \u2018Project Iceman\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Yes Theory\u2019s decision to exclusively use funding from <strong>blockchain-based sources<\/strong> is based off the premise of maintaining full creative control over the project, whilst also being able to build a community where members become investors and digital owners of the film. In accordance with such ethos, the producers reportedly turned down a $1.25 million investment offer from a major (but undisclosed) streaming service.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The fundraising will see the launch of NFTs in four tiers of rarity, \u2018The World\u2019s Coldest Movie Tickets,\u2019 \u2018The Ice Squad,\u2019 \u2018The Owner\u2019s Table\u2019 and \u2018The Executive Producer\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Here, \u2019The World\u2019s Coldest Movie Tickets\u2019 will cost $50 to mint, and will include a ticket to the film\u2019s exclusive virtual premiere, three-day exclusive access to knowing the whereabouts of the physical red carpet premieres (with a 50% discount on tickets), voting for an additional city for the film to be premiered in, and more. Although there is a supply of 10,000, only 5,000 will be available to mint as an NFT, as the remaining 5,000 will be sold as regular tickets on \u2018Seek Discomfort\u2019.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The more exclusive \u2018The Ice Squad\u2019 NFTs will cost $1,500 to mint, and will include pre-access to future events and NFT launches of Yes Theory and Project Iceman, two VIP tickets to a premiere (where they will meet Hofman and the rest of the film\u2019s team), access to the \u2018Ice Squad\u2019s\u2019 Discord channel, a featuring on the film\u2019s credits, and more. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The 25 \u2018The Owner\u2019s Table\u2019 NFTs intuitively increase in <strong>exclusivity<\/strong> even more, as they will each cost a hefty $1,5000 to mint, and will include a unique 10-second clip from the film, a \u2018seat at the table\u2019 in Yes Theory (where you essentially become part of executive decisions), four VIP tickets to a red carpet premiere and after party, all other perks from \u2018The Ice Squad,\u2019 and more.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The pinnacle of the launch is the singular \u2018Executive Producer\u2019 NFT, which, as its name suggests, will allow its owner to become an executive producer of the film.
