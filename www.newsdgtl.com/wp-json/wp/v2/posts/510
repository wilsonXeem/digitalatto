The message read the following: \u201cWe noticed you were able to exploit the Solana VAA verification and mint tokens.

Last week there was a different bridge exploit on the Ethereum BSC bridge called Qubit. This is clearly a major risk within crypto, which can be mitigated by withdrawing coins directly from exchanges where possible.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p><script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n!function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s){if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?\nn.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;\nn.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;\nt.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window,\ndocument,'script','https:\/\/connect.facebook.net\/en_US\/fbevents.js');\n<\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.the-blockchain.com\/2022\/02\/04\/eth-returned-to-users-after-wednesdays-major-wormhole-hack\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After the Wormhole hack on Wednesday, when the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Wormhole became the victim of the largest cryptocurrency theft this year, Jump Trading restored every user\u2019s funds, totalling to over $320 million.
