Its TVL on Ethereum was at $10.32 billion on April 6. After reducing investor interest, its TVL decreased 17% or equivalent to $8.47 billion on May 22.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meanwhile, its TVL on its all-time high on Terra was at roughly $9.66 billion. However, the figures dropped 99% on May 22, or approximately $14,870 in six weeks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">LDO TVL on Solana used to be hovering at $417.17 million, but it went down by nearly 70% or roughly $126.24 million on May 22.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/aO6i4fpQ\/\" width=\"1824\" height=\"870\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">LDO total market cap at $395 million on the daily chart | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lido TVL on Moonriver was at $2.57 million during the height of dApps popularity. However, when investor interest waned, the values also crashed by 27%, equivalent to $1.86 million seen in that same period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After crashing by more than $11 billion, LDO has been demoted from the ranks close to MakerDAO and Curve.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>LDO Still Superior In TVL<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On the flip side, despite Lido\u2019s drop in terms of TVL, it still is superior in TVL compared to Convex Finance, JustLend, Aave, SushiSwap, Uniswap, Instadapp, PancakeSwap, Compound, and Just Lend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It opened on April 6, trading at $4.27. However, the coin dropped on May 12 at $1.23 and seems to be not going over the $1.33 mark today. Looking at those figures, this would give you as much as a 68% loss in LDO price in just six weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Suggested Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-reclaims-30k-territory\/\">Bitcoin Reclaims $30K Territory After Recent Weeks\u2019 Struggle \u2013 Analysts Weigh In<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><b>Polygon Launch This Month<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lido is currently the leading Ethereum liquid staking solution that comprises a large share of over 80% in that space.
