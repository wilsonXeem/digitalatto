We are already working on resources to improve the graphics, but it will take dedicated converter development to incorporate them into the actual game, so we cannot yet show you the improved graphics in the alpha version, but we plan to release them in the beta version. We hope that everyone will take this opportunity to experience the Metaverse GameFi project as never before.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This closed alpha will see a select few get the chance to be a part of the testing period that will end with limited edition NFTs being awarded to the participants. Applications for joining the closed alpha have been announced. It will take place in a lottery-style system where users sign up for the Closed Alpha Bronze Tickets.<\/p>\n<p>Winners of this lottery will be provided exclusive access to the Gensokishi Online Closed Alpha Test. At the end of the testing period, players will be ranked on a point system using the \u201cAlpha Hunter\u2019s Certificate\u201d which will drop at a certain probability rate when players defeat monsters during in-game play.<\/p>\n<p>The top 10 ranking players at the end will receive limited edition NFTs. The other players are not left out though. The top 11 to 100 players will also receive a limited edition NFT at the end of the testing phase.<\/p>\n<h3>How To Apply For Gensokishi Closed Alpha<\/h3>\n<p>Applications for the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/genso.game\/news\/detail\/?seq=4c444b386c78723158495a574432464c72636c7132673d3d\">Gensokishi Online Closed Alpha Bronze Ticket lottery<\/a> is already ongoing.

It also set the record for the fastest project ever launched by Trustpad after selling out in 20 seconds.<\/p>\n<p>Its launch on crypto exchange Bybit saw a record 65,000 participants stake more than $220 million to earn $MV tokens, the official token of Gensokishi Online.
