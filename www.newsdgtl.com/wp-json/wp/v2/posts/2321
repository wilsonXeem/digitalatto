According to the open letter, the digital asset will be launched in partnership with \u201cmajor blockchain players\u201d and will be \u201cthe most decentralized stablecoin in human history\u201d. Sun said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TRON is starting a self-imposed revolution, pooling all its resources to create USDD, a fully decentralized stablecoin underpinned by mathematics and algorithms, bringing the development of stablecoin to the next level.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The stablecoin will be managed by the TRON DAO and \u201cother major blockchain institutions\u201d and will maintain a 1:1 pegged to the U.S. dollar with, as Sun explained, \u201cproper algorithms in a decentralized manner\u201d and \u201cby applying mathematics\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The stablecoin will operate with a similar mechanism to Terra\u2019s UST. Users will be able to redeem 1 USDD for 1 USD worth of TRX when the stablecoin drops below its peg. They can do the opposite if the price of the stablecoin rises about its $1 pegged.<\/p>\n<p>The stablecoin will follow a four-stage roadmap. The first stage will be called Space, the following International Space Station (ISS), then Moon, and finally Mars. Sun only provided details on the first two stages which mainly centered around USDD\u2019s management and the strategies that will try to keep the stablecoin\u2019s pegged.<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s TRON Ultimate Goal With Their Stablecoin?<\/h2>\n<p>The launch of TRON\u2019s stablecoin is part of a \u201cself-imposed revolution\u201d that will take these digital assets to their next stage, according to Sun. This movement is supposed to provide users with a way out of the centralized system. Sun wrote:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The decentralized stablecoin USDD will free holders from central authorities\u2019 arbitrary impositions and eliminate all entry barriers. Unlike centralized institutions that may freeze or confiscate users\u2019 funds at will, decentralized stablecoins effectively safeguard private property rights.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>TRON claims that it wants to provide \u201cequitable\u201d access to financial services for people around the world. In that sense, Sun said TRON will be \u201cone of the strongest cornerstones for the fifth freedom of humanity\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>This announcement has caused controversy in the crypto community. Some users accused Sun of copying Terra\u2019s UST model.<\/p>\n<p>The founder of Terra and CEO at Terraform Labs, Do Kwon, welcomed the initiative and hinted at a potential partnership with TRON.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of writing, TRON trades at $0.07 with a 15% rally in the last 24-hours. The cryptocurrency is possibly reacting to the announcement and the general sentiment in the market.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/eth\/ethereum-strong-rally-3130\/\">TA: Ethereum Could Stage Strong Rally If It Clears This Key Resistance<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If launched successfully, USDD will provide its users with the largest APY for staking a stablecoin in the crypto ecosystem.
