The <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a> market is the best example of that. These days, there are thousands of projects that help each other grow by providing assistance and lending a helping hand. However, crypto projects are not limited to only helping other crypto projects. Today, there are several projects that continuously donate to different charitable organizations. Such projects often have a strong community that supports them in such decisions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One such project is Savanna, also known as SVN. This crypto project has yet to achieve its full potential, of course. However, it is one of the few credible projects that have built-in mechanisms dedicated to charities. Throughout this article, we will talk about the fundamentals of this crypto project. Moreover, we will also touch upon its future potential and plans.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savanna (SVN) Fundamental Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In essence, Savanna is a cryptocurrency project operating on the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-smart-chain-bsc\/\">Binance Smart Chain (BSC)<\/a>. Similar to many tokens, Savanna benefits from the cheap and fast transactions in the BSC. When compared to the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-ethereum-a-step-by-step-guide\/\">Ethereum<\/a> blockchain, BSC is the go-to blockchain for tokens that start from scratch. That being said, Savanna\u2019s SVN is a BEP20 token.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Savanna is not the first of its kind, we believe that it is one of the best of its kind. This is because they have all the elements needed to dominate the crypto space. Nevertheless, they are still a very young project and have a low market capitalization. This means that they have more room to grow in price. As such, investing in projects like Savanna may leave you with much higher profits than investing in projects that have a large market capitalization.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savanna\u2019s Mission<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As stated before, Savanna\u2019s mission is simple, they want to give back to their community and constantly donate to charities. In essence, Savanna is a charity token that will donate 3% of each transaction to different charities throughout Africa. That being said, Savanna has a charitable mission and aims to show the world that <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchain<\/a> technology can be used for doing good deeds.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roadmap<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to their roadmap, Savanna is going to go through quite a journey. Similar to nearly every project, their roadmap is divided into several phases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>First Phase:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Their initial phase is focused on donating taxed profits to charity. Since their main goal is helping people through donations, such action is welcomed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Second Phase: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving on, they mention community building. Throughout the second phase, team of Savanna will focus on developing their community even further. Moreover, they will go on with interactive activities to keep the community as engaged as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Third Phase: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After focusing on their community throughout the first two phases of the roadmap, they will shift their focus towards marketing. During the third phase of the project, they plan to expand the marketing team by adding more experts to the team. Furthermore, they will join the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-are-nft-non-fungible-tokens\/\">non-fungible token (NFT)<\/a> world so that they can gather more funds for charity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Fourth Phase: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their final phase acts as the cherry on top. After growing a healthy community and expanding its team, Savanna aims to get listed on big exchanges and acquire more partnerships that will help it go mainstream. Such things will serve as catalyzers for bigger investments. The fourth phase is the final phase of their current roadmap. However, this does not mean that Savanna will stop there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other than the goals included in the roadmap, Savanna has some other things in mind too. According to their roadmap, they will focus on developing a web-built token tracker and function as a DAO through feedback surveys and community votes. They even plan to launch their own cryptocurrency exchange platform sometime in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokenomics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per its <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-tokenomics\/\">tokenomics<\/a>, Savanna uses similar tokenomics to several other BEP20 tokens. Per each transaction you make using Savanna, you will pay a 10% tax. This tax is then split between several wallets. 3% goes to the charity wallet; 5% is redistributed to all holders; 0.8% goes to the liquidity wallet; 1.2% goes to the marketing\/development wallet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think of it this way. Per each transaction, 5% will go towards charities all around Africa and coin development. The other 5% will be distributed as holding (HODLer) rewards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, their tokenomics implements a method they call \u201cEarn, burn, and donate.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savanna (SVN) Price Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savanna is relatively new to the cryptocurrency market. As a matter of fact, Savanna joined the market just a few months ago and has been skyrocketing ever since. According to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/poocoin.app\/tokens\/0x816cd1e0412943d1d3a1a1fdaee1809879c95e22\">PooCoin<\/a>, Savanna joined the market with a price of $0.000000000003 on the 25th of November 2021. However, only three weeks after making its debut, on the 14th of December 2021, Savanna hit a trading value of $0.000000000352. This was huge for them, but their growth did not stop there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the 1st of January 2022, Savanna had a similar price as in the prior month. Nevertheless, everything changed when February came by. On the 1st of February, Savanna experienced a 4x on its price, hitting a new all-time high of $0.000000001213. The price of SVN kept growing for weeks, setting its current all-time high on the 26th of February by reaching a price of $0.000000004199.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of writing, the PooCoin chart reports that SVN is <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/investing-vs-trading-crypto\/\">trading<\/a> at a price of $0.000000003482.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savanna (SVN) Market Price Predictions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before going into our price prediction for Savanna, let us take a look at some other predictions for SVN. We will touch upon Savanna forecasts from two cryptocurrency Youtubers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goalorius<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goalorius is a relatively new cryptocurrency Youtuber and has covered several cryptos and tokens in his channel. Just recently, he also made a video about Savanna, where he talked about the project\u2019s background, team, story, and goal. In his video, he emphasizes that Savanna is one of the few projects that promote a viable solution to charities in Africa. He also believes that Savanna has already built a good foundation for their token. To finish the video, Goalorius implies that SVN has the potential to increase in price in the future because they are such a young token.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><noscript><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Savanna \ud83e\udd81 Africa\u2019s Solution to Charitable Trading \ud83e\udd81 $SVN\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/98X0_z4iolM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/noscript><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crypto Moonlight<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to Goalorius, Crypto Moonlight is a relatively new cryptocurrency Youtuber. He has been gaining lots of attention by creating videos regarding several different cryptocurrencies, tokens, and NFT collections. In his video related to Savanna, he begins by praising the team of Savanna on their mission. He claims that Savanna is one of the few new tokens that focuses on charities rather than memes. Again, after talking about all the noticeable features that Savanna has, he implies that this <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/token-meaning-what-is-a-cryptocurrency-token\/\">token<\/a> could blow up sometime in the near future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><noscript><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Charity Crypto Focused In Africa? 100x Potential? Savana Global!\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ceQMO0GPxg0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/noscript><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crypto Academy Savanna (SVN) Price Prediction<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We at <\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/category\/price-prediction\/\"><b>Crypto Academy <\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">always do our own research and we suggest you do the same. When it comes to Savanna, we did thorough research and analyzed its market to come up with a price prediction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savanna (SVN) Price Prediction 2022<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the year 2022 was not that welcoming to the cryptocurrency market, Savanna performed very well. Unlike most cryptocurrencies and tokens, even the major ones such as Bitcoin, Savanna is trading at a higher price than it was at the beginning of 2022. Only a handful of cryptocurrencies and tokens are doing so, and some of them are <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/terra-luna-price-prediction-2022\/\">Terra<\/a> and Savanna.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may not seem that significant, however, it holds much importance. That is because this makes the project more resistant to Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. Being as independent as possible is always good. As for the rest of 2022, we believe that SVN could reach a trading value of $0.000000013531 sometime during the year. Yet, the price of SVN might go back to $0.000000006000 shortly after hitting such a milestone.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savanna (SVN) Price Prediction 2023<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the year 2023, most people suspect that it might not be that <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bearish-bullish-meaning-in-cryptocurrency\/\">bullish<\/a>. Considering the amount of gains people made during 2021 and 2022, a short bear market seems possible. Nevertheless, that does not mean that prices will fall by 90% as they did in 2017. This only means that the market might not experience any significant market movements during 2023.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this, SVN might gradually increase in price in 2023. This is because it is a low-cap token and still has a small community. As time passes by, this project\u2019s community might grow, resulting in a bigger market cap. This could leave SVN with an all-time high of $0.000000031429 in 2023. If the market does not perform decently though, SVN could be left with a price of $0.000000012132.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savanna (SVN) Price Prediction 2024<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The year 2024 holds special significance for the cryptocurrency market because the next<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin-halving\/\"> Bitcoin halving<\/a> is set to occur. This event often initiates a bull market some months after it occurs. This event previously happened in 2012, 2016, and 2020. With each halving, came a bull run several months after, with the last one being the mindblowing bull run of 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering this, the cryptocurrency market is likely to become bullish sometime during 2024. This could have a major impact on the market performance of SVN as well. By the end of 2024, our forecast shows Savanna trading at a price of $0.000000194131.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savanna (SVN) Price Prediction 2025<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The real fun begins the year after the Bitcoin halving event takes place, of course. After 2024, the year 2025 could be even more fruitful for the cryptocurrency market. In 2025, mass adoption is likely to be happening at a faster pace. That and the aftermath of the Bitcoin halving event could boost the market\u2019s performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Savanna, our forecast shows that it might experience huge spikes during the year 2025. This may leave Savanna with a yearly high of $0.000000831251 and a yearly low of $0.00000033193.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savanna (SVN) Price Prediction 2026<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By 2026, the market is likely to be less <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-volatility\/\">volatile<\/a> than it is today. This may result in smaller price movements and more stable charts. However, that is not necessarily a bad thing. The more the world implements cryptocurrencies, the more money flows into them. Therefore, although the market\u2019s volatility may decrease, its value could increase.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24094\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24094\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-24094 size-full\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Savanna Price Forecast\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-1-10.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-24094 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CRYPTO-ACADEMY-CHART-1-10.png\" alt=\"Savanna Price Forecast\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24094\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Savanna (SVN) Price Prediction 2022-2026.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SVN is most likely going to be affected by this as well. So, by the end of the year 2026, Savanna may be able to surpass the $0.000001000000 milestone. This would mark a growth of nearly 1000x from the price SVN has at the time of writing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to buy Savanna?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buying Savanna is not as complicated as it seems. Although you cannot purchase Savanna directly from a centralized exchange, you can buy it using a decentralized exchange. The best exchange for purchasing SVN is PancakeSwap.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 1: Create an Exchange Account<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To use <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/pancakeswap-review-2022\/\">PancakeSwap<\/a>, you must first purchase BNB or BUSD. In our case, we will purchase <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/binance-coin-price-prediction-2021\/\">BNB<\/a> since the SVN\/BNB pool provides more liquidity. To purchase BNB, you will need to open a Binance account. After you create a Binance account, you need to verify it, a process that usually lasts a couple of minutes. However, you will need to wait some hours before you get a confirmation that your account has been verified.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24095\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24095\" style=\"width: 1916px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24095\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Creating Binance Account to Buy SVN\" width=\"800\" height=\"392\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Create_Binance_Account.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-24095\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Create_Binance_Account.png\" alt=\"Creating Binance Account to Buy SVN\" width=\"800\" height=\"392\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24095\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Creating Binance Account.

After importing Savanna, enter the amount of Savanna you want to purchase and finalize the swap. At the time of writing, the slippage tolerance should be set at 13% for the transaction to go through. However, make sure to check their official website for any more information.

It joined the market just recently and has a fully doxxed team. Moving on, Savanna aims to change the way people see blockchain technology and wants to use the power of this technology to do good. Their main goal is to collect funds to donate to different African charities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is Savanna (SVN) a Good Investment?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. At the time of writing, Savanna has a very low <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\">market capitalization<\/a>.
