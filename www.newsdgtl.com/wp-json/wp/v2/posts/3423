The price initially declined by more than 30%. BTC ended the year at around $50,000.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2022, BTC maintained that similar approach, where the price declined by an additional 35% in the first few weeks of the year. After finding support at $33,000, the price had a correction. In the following weeks, the price was highly <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-volatility\/\">volatile<\/a> and slightly recovered. BTC managed to increase by almost 40% in the following weeks of the first quarter, but it faced resistance at $48,000. This increase led to BTC becoming overbought in the 1-day chart, hence a retracement was imminent. Nonetheless, that retracement was bigger than anticipated by BTC holders as support at $39,000 was eventually broken.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of that, BTC continued to decline in the 1-day chart, and it has declined by more than 18% in the last few days. This decline is relatively large for the crypto market as Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency with the largest <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\">market capitalization<\/a>. However, Bitcoin is currently facing support at $33,000, in the previous support structure back in January.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fear and greed index shows signs of fear in the 1-day chart. Moreover, Bollinger bands show a considerable increase in price volatility and trading volume. On a bullish note, the price is now below the lower band, meaning that we could see the price of BTC have another go upward in the coming days.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_25562\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-25562\" style=\"width: 2474px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-25562 size-full\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Bitcoin (BTC) Monthly Price Analysis May\" width=\"800\" height=\"403\" data-lazy- data-lazy- data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/month-2.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-25562 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/month-2.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin (BTC) Monthly Price Analysis May\" width=\"800\" height=\"403\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-25562\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">BTC\/USDT 1-Day Chart.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key Structures<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Support<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resistance<\/span><\/h3>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indicators<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving Average<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both the 20-MA and the 50-MA lines of a 1-day chart are currently above the price of BTC, meaning that the current trend is downward for Bitcoin and that the price may decline in the coming day\/weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 9-<\/span><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/exponential-moving-average-ema-definition\/#:~:text=The%20exponential%20moving%20average%20(EMA)%20is%20a%20moving%20average%20that,average%20(SMA)%20is%20recommended.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EMA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of a 1-day chart is also above the price of BTC, meaning that BTC is <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bearish-bullish-meaning-in-cryptocurrency\/\">bearish<\/a> in the shorter run as well.

While this may not have a direct impact on Bitcoin, it may have on Bitcoin traders. When looking at history, the last time the Fed made changes regarding rates when the latter were zero was back in 2017. At the same time, that\u2019s when BTC had one of its historical bull runs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look at the following thread to see what Gert van Lagen had to say on his Twitter:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">What happened last time the FED came up with a lot of subsequent rate hikes after being zero for a long time?<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$BTC<\/a> entered the 2017 bullmarket. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/lmcIoxXrvN\">pic.twitter.com\/lmcIoxXrvN<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Gert van Lagen (@GertvanLagen) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GertvanLagen\/status\/1521434874065866753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 3, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, BTC is highly dependent on the support that it has from institutional investors. Perhaps one of the biggest proponents of Bitcoin is Michael Saylor and his company, MicroStrategy. The latter has stated that they will do no matter what to keep BTC above $21,000. If that occurs, then it will lead to a margin call for the billion dollars-worth venture. This is because Saylor and his team took a loan to purchase BTC back in August of 2020.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, Saylor has tried to keep the situation in a rather fun way. Recently, he tweeted an edited picture of him in a McDonald\u2019s uniform, implying that the market has put him in a position to work on a 9-to-5. All the funny aspects aside, Saylor remains one of the biggest supporters of BTC.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Monday morning is time to get back to work. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/JlufLXRT9W\">pic.twitter.com\/JlufLXRT9W<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/saylor\/status\/1523646766549434373?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 9, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bitcoin-price-prediction-may-2022\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>BTC Technical Analysis \u2013 May 2022 Ever since Bitcoin (BTC) reached its all-time high in November of 2021 at around $69,000, the price has been in a downtrend.
