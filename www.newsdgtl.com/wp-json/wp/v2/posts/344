Any sign of recovery in industries in industries such as manufacturing, semiconductors and automotive, are at risk from ongoing supply chain disruption. With a churn of events\u00a0 impacting pricing and materials availability, many are now bracing for a longer recovery on uncertain terms.<\/p>\n<p>New and compounding challenges demand new approaches. If supply chain leaders once aspired for perfection, resilience and agility are now today\u2019s mantras. Those who got a head start on digital acceleration are in no position to lose focus. They need to aggressively build operating models that are both predictive and proactive to anticipate and prepare for issues seen and unseen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>From planning and risk mitigation to value creation, cloud and AI are key to transformation <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Shipping giants such as Maersk already benefit from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/mediacenter.ibm.com\/media\/Maersk%20%2B%20IBM%20Cloud\/1_4o58is95\">hosting business applications like container trackers on cloud<\/a>.

In other words, as supply chains transform, their need for available trustworthy data used in machine learning models will become even more critical. An integration of a trusted and secure <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/topics\/data-fabric\">data fabric<\/a> that brings together people, data processes and tools is a way forward for organizations digitizing their supply chains.<\/p>\n<p>With more trusted data available to build models, machine learning can unearth powerful insights from operational data, weather, and news updates to track and predict supply chain disruptions. They can also recommend alternative actions, such as new transportation routes that cut through the fog of uncertainty.<\/p>\n<p>Visualization and digital twins can help operators orchestrate execution by simulating models of the extended supply chain and showing more clearly where bottlenecks and risks reside. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/learn\/process-mining\">Process mining<\/a>, too, can discover inefficiencies and optimize supply chain processes when integrated across multiple data models. With the cloud, organizations can extend those benefits to all supply chain partners, not just those in the enterprise.<\/p>\n<p>Learn about five essential strategies to build more resilient supply chain, including digital transformation, improved sustainability, and workforce evolution.
