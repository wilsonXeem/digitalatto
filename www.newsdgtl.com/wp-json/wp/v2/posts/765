Tracking all of this data can rapidly become burdensome, a reason a tool was developed to ease this task \u2013 blockchain explorers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain explorers are <strong>useful tools for tracking these transactions<\/strong>, looking up wallet addresses, and more. A blockchain explorer sends out a search query when a user types it into the explorer\u2019s search bar. The blockchain explorer then connects to a node via an application programming interface (API) and retrieves the necessary data. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It orders and lists all essential data and displays it to the user in a searchable style once it has been extracted. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Etherscan is the blockchain explorer for the Ethereum network, just as Bscscan is to Binance Smart Chain.\u00a0<\/span>So let\u2019s take a look at what Etherscan is and how it can be useful in your NFT journey.<\/p>\n<h4><b>What is Etherscan?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Etherscan will find anything that happens on the Ethereum blockchain. It is the leading Ethereum blockchain explorer, search engine, API, and analytics platform. NFT mints, transactions, and trades are all included in <strong>the data that will pop up for users who use Etherscan for tracking<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a nutshell, Etherscan is to Ethereum as Google is to the internet. Etherscan is a search engine for the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to find and validate transactions. You may also use Etherscan to see all of the information about any pending or completed transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t have to create an account to use Etherscan, but it is advisable to sign up for an account, especially if you wish to access developer tools. However, it\u2019s important to note that Etherscan isn\u2019t a wallet; instead, it\u2019s a source of data and information relating to the Ethereum blockchain.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Is Etherscan compatible with NFTs?\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most NFTs out there are mainly minted on the Ethereum blockchain. Users that purchase these NFTs will be able to see their assets on Etherscan, although NFTs on Etherscan will only be seen as a token and not as art.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users will have to rely on external services such as marketplaces like OpenSea, to view the entire artwork. Although Etherscan cannot display art, it will display the token ID, the project to which it belongs, the transaction record, and the smart contract code. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding smart contracts is necessary for determining a project\u2019s popularity, ownership rights, security audits, and more. You can also see <strong>how many smart contracts a particular wallet has approved.<\/strong> This is useful in unveiling the identity of a new project created by an anonymous developer who might be involved in a rug pull.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gas tracker is another vital feature of Etherscan which allows you to keep track of transactional gas prices measured in gwei.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>How to read smart contracts of NFTs on Etherscan<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A smart contract is a blockchain-based contract consisting of code strings, self and automatically executing when some specific pre-defined circumstances are met. In the case of NFTs, a smart contract contains all asset data, including ownership and transaction details.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>As a result, before investing, <strong>NFT collectors must carefully examine the smart contract<\/strong> of a project. Etherscan can assist you here. You can also mint NFTs directly from the smart contract.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Where to get a smart contract<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may ask, where does one get a smart contract? The contract address for several NFT projects can be found on their official website. Paste this into Etherscan\u2019s smart contract data search bar. If you don\u2019t know where to find the smart contract address, go to OpenSea or other marketplaces and search for the NFT you\u2019re looking for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Then go to the \u2018Details\u2019 tab and look for \u2018Contract Address.\u2019 This will open the related smart contract page on Etherscan when you click on it. If accessible, you can also discover the token address on CoinMarketCap.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Etherscan will provide the following information:<\/strong> General information, tracker, transactions, and contract. Under the \u201ccontract\u201d section is where you will discover all of the information regarding a particular smart contract. The \u2018Code\u2019 page contains the contract\u2019s source code, while the \u2018Read Contract\u2019 tab has the contract\u2019s general information.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Minting NFTs with Etherscan<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ordinarily, NFTs are minted by collectors on the official main project website. However, if it\u2019s a well-publicized launch, it is possible that the website may slow down due to increased flow of traffic to the project website. If this happens, minting NFTs directly from the project\u2019s smart contract on Etherscan is better. Although, this will only work for new projects that are yet to be sold out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Below are the steps to mint NFTs on Etherscan:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet; this will be used to mint and incur additional costs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Search for the smart contract and link your wallet using the \u201cConnect to Web3\u201d option.<\/li>\n<li>Select the \u201cMint Contract\u201d function.<\/li>\n<li>Enter the amount of ETH and the number of tokens you want to mint. Check to see whether you provided the correct information. Then press the \u2018Write\u2019 button. Finally, confirm the transaction. And there you have it! Your mint is done!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Etherscan is a simple and free Ethereum blockchain explorer tool that comes in handy when you require more information than your wallet or exchange can provide. Etherscan is an excellent place to start if you want to confirm the status of a transaction or look at the smart contract of your favourite NFT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
