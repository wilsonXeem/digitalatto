Therefore, 11,111 fearsome ladies of singular ambition will descend on the meta-realm, with the prime goal of spreading their own brand of non-fungible chaos to the unsuspecting masses.<\/p>\n<p>A product from the unique mind of teenage art sensation, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SalamandreArt\">Salamandre<\/a>, Femmes Bizarre brings together a wave of hand drawn artistry with algorithmically generated scarcity. All resulting in a collection unrivalled by any other on the blockchain.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h4><strong>NFTs with Attitude<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Femmes Bizarre comes in exactly 11,111 unique ladies of formidable character and randomized scarcity, spanning three designs and over 300 individual traits. These <strong>hand-drawn masterpieces feature a core cast of three ladies,<\/strong> each with her own bespoke personality, and handpicked taste in music.<\/p>\n<p>Matilda is your classic chain-smoking, jazz-loving succubus. Uma, a wild and judgmental coffee enthusiast with a penchant for contemporary smooth rock, while Lilu comes in as a sweet-faced, hard playing secret agent with a soft spot for early 2000\u2019s pop music.<\/p>\n<p>Each NFT will live on the Ethereum blockchain in the shape of an ERC-721 token, heading this way soon, at a date yet to be confirmed. Those looking to get a jump on the competition can look to the Femmes Bizarre socials to claim a coveted whitelist spot and mint at a discounted price of 0.06 ETH. Following shortly afterwards, <strong>a public sale will commence offering NFTs for 0.08 ETH<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>All of the NFTs will arrive via a blind drop, maintaining an air of mystery for the first few days. Following which, a grand reveal will uncover the secrets held within.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Roadmap and Future Plans<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Throughout the drop, Femmes Bizarre will release a whole host of bonus content to its avid collectors. Hitting the 25% mark, they will airdrop 25 NFTs to members of its community. At 50% it will deploy 50 more, in addition to sharing a unique high-quality DJ set. Then, at 100%, <strong>the Femmes will circulate 100 NFTs from 10 different prominent collections<\/strong> to 100 lucky owners, as well as making their first charitable donation providing chess classes to autistic children.<\/p>\n<p>Following the complete sale, the team will begin its second phase of operations by revealing roadmap 2.0. Wherein, rumours abound of a Femmes Bizarre comic book, as they look to flesh out the brand. Further on, more collectibles will arrive on the blockchain, featuring Salamandre\u2019s vivid and highly recognizable style.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-34905 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Femmes-Bizarre-NFT-Collection.jpg\" alt=\"Femmes Bizarre NFT Collection\" width=\"1000\" height=\"429\"  \/><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Charitable Endeavours<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Looking to give something back and help their fellow human beings, Femmes Bizarre has side-lined a portion of profits to help the autistic community.
