Regarding the event, Larrey said that working with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/sensoriumgalaxy.com\/\">Sensorium<\/a> will allow them to investigate ways of democratizing art. In addition, they will make it more accessible to individuals around the world regardless of their socioeconomic and geographic limits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In conclusion, Fr.

Given their popularity, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-blockchain\/\">blockchains<\/a> and NFTs have attracted a lot of investment from companies looking to become digital. Worth mentioning is one of the reasons for focusing on digital footprint, which is Covid and its subsequent lockdowns. Like many businesses, the Vatican is following the same path as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Looking at the NFTs museum, you need virtual reality headsets and desktop computers to be able to visit the museum later this year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One may see a wide variety of art and antiquities from all over the world in the Vatican. It hosts the most beautiful art on a global scale. From Michelangelo and Raphael to Wassily Kandinsky and Vincent van Gogh, the Vatican Museums have over 800 works of art. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Despite the announcement, there is no certain word on whether or when the Vatican\u2019s collection will be made available for purchase as NFTs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/vatican-nft-gallery-around-the-world\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On the 2nd of May, the Vatican announced the launching of a non-fungible token (NFT) art gallery.
