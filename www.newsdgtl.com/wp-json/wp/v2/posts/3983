Gradual push from the bears have caused the digital asset to trade below its resistance lines. At press time, the coin was trading close to its immediate support level because the market received a fall in buying strength.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last 24 hours, the altcoin registered a sharp fall by 9% forcing the coin trade near the local support.<\/p>\n<p>Immediate resistance for ATOM stood at $13.73 and to trade above the same ATOM would need support of the buyers.

If buyers find a way back into the market then the coin can attempt to trade near the $13 price mark.<\/p>\n<p>A rejection from the aforementioned price level will push the coin beneath the $9.42 support level. The coin traded near the $9.40 level last year in the month of July.<\/p>\n<p>The Relative Strength Index displayed an uptick because the indicator was seen above the oversold region.
