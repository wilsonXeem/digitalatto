The introduction of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.overthereality.ai\/blog\/ibco-voting-proposal\/\">IBCO<\/a> provides a variable amount of $OVR\u00a0 by issuing new tokens in response to price increases (when individuals buy OVR with DAI on the IBCO) and burns them in response to price declines (by acquiring tokens from the market with DAI reserves). Therefore, the IBCO\u2019s ability to absorb liquidity is the key to accelerated token burn.<\/p>\n<p>From the KuCoin listing to the IBCO update, Over the reality metaverse platform is constantly working to build a highly profitable ecosystem without compromising on users\u2019 experience.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/company\/over-the-reality-a-leading-metaverse-platform-announces-token-listing-on-kucoin-and-ibco-enabled-burning\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From 2021 till now, the metaverse concept has increasingly gained popularity and evidently has no plans of slowing down.
