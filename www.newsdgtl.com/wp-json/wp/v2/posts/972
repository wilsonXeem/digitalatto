There are several factors contributing to the current rally.<\/p>\n<p>This includes the full implementation of smart contract capabilities, the increase in developer activity recorded by the network, the improvement of Cardano to make it more decentralized and scalable, according to its main developer IOG.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, the above factors have translated into an ecosystem explosion. There are hundreds of projects building on Cardano which could be re-fueling the Ethereum Killer narrative.<\/p>\n<p>IOG recently highlighted some of these projects. Via their official Twitter handle, the company <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/InputOutputHK\/status\/1508443869012275208?s=20&amp;t=DUnNOLO3RRQINpC65tdOdQ\">said<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Cardano ecosystem is growing by leaps and bounds, with new players entering the ecosystem every day. Let\u2019s start this week with a recap of the latest news &amp; announcements from projects Building On Cardano and contributing to its growth.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Among these projects is Milkomeda. Created as a scalability solution for Cardano, this project is set to integrate the network with Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVM) capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>The project was <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Milkomeda_com\/status\/1507411375186128896\">launched<\/a> on March 28 on Cardano. In the future, this network will be able to integrate with other blockchains, such as Avalanche, and Algorand.<\/p>\n<p>IOG also mentioned Ergo, a decentralized exchange that will be deployed in the Cardano testnet on April 4. In addition, this network will see more use cases with the future launch of a converter bridge solution, created by Singularity, and real asset tokenization with the Indigo Protocol.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udce2Announcement for Indigo x Cornucopias!<\/p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf0fWe&#8217;ve officially partnered with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CornucopiasGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CornucopiasGame<\/a> to bring Indigo 3D Assets to the Metaverse.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd39It is exciting to work alongside leading <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Metaverse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Metaverse<\/a> projects to offer a unique user experience for the future!<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd2eFollow <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Indigo_protocol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Indigo_protocol<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/yKkGa6TWGM\">pic.twitter.com\/yKkGa6TWGM<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 \ud83d\udd2e Indigo | Synthetic Assets on Cardano (@Indigo_protocol) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Indigo_protocol\/status\/1504941664196075520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Cardano Growth Beyond Expectations, Institutions Want More ADA<\/h2>\n<p>The inventor of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, celebrated the growth of the project. In 2021, Hoskinson predicted a boom in the number of projects building on this network, and the number of assets launched on Cardano. Via Twitter, he <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IOHK_Charles\/status\/1506633303838887936\">posted<\/a> that there are \u201cmillions\u201d of both surpassing his expectations.<\/p>\n<p>In the coming months, this number seems poised to climb as the network prepares for another Hard Fork Combinator (HFC) event. Dubbed \u201cVasil\u201d, Hoskinson believes it will trigger another surge in network activity, and potential total value locked (TVL).<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What most also don&#8217;t understand is that many Cardano DApps are waiting for the Vasil hardfork in June to launch to benefit from pipelining.
