The main reason she advocates is to address concerns about financial stability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Following the statement of Yellen, she notes that stablecoins should be subject to federal regulation. Additionally, Yellen addressed this issue to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday in reference to a November report from the President&#8217;s Working Group on Financial Markets. Regarding the issue, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin added some comments referring to TerraUSD (UST). As per the record, TerraUSD is the third-largest stablecoin by <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\">market capitalization<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Furthermore, Yellen thinks that the TerraUSD case just highlights that this is a quickly increasing product. Therefore, there are risks to financial stability, and the main step they should take is building a suitable structure.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A Uniform Federal Framework<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In light of the UST scenario, Senator of Pennsylvania Pat Toomey drew attention to the fact that UST is an algorithmic stablecoin. In regard, Toomey emphasized that it is not backed by cash or securities. Correspondingly, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew noted that they should push for a uniform federal framework on stablecoins by the end of 2022. In order to implement this approach, she urged members of Congress to work together across party lines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Looking at Yellen&#8217;s written testimony, the Financial Stability Oversight Council was working on a report in accordance with President Joe Biden&#8217;s executive order. The main focus of the report was on digital assets, assessing potential threats to financial stability and any regulatory gaps. As part of efforts to build a national framework on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">crypto<\/a>, the order asked for the coordination and consolidation of policy by numerous government entities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In general analyses, there are different concerns that Treasury Department has encountered. The main concerns include token initiatives associated with illegal financing and money laundering.
