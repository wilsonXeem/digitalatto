First download the chrome extension if you want to create a wallet on a desktop or download the mobile app if you want to create a wallet on your phone. You can create a wallet with a 12-word phrase or a 24 word phrase. It\u2019s important to note that this should be written down somewhere secure and never shared. The best practice is to write this 12-word phrase down on a piece of paper stored away safely. Do not keep this phrase on your mobile phone, for safety reasons. You can also secure the wallet login using face ID on your phone. Just an FYI, MetaMask users\u2019 identities remain anonymous.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Rad Rabbits NFTs cost a certain amount of the cryptocurrency Ethereum. Once you know which Rad Rabbit you want to purchase, connect your MetaMask wallet to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\">OpenSea<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Once the wallet is connected, you can select which <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/radrabbits\">Rad Rabbit<\/a> you\u2019d like to add to your collection and press \u201cBuy Now\u201d and continue through the checkout process. You will need to account for gas fees \u2013 so make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet for gas fees. A gas fee is a term used to describe a \u201ctransaction\u201d fee.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2 \u2013<\/strong> <strong>Purchasing Ethereum- (to purchase NFT\u2019s and pay for gas fees)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-489815 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Picture69.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"527\" height=\"285\"  \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The second step in purchasing any NFT, is to buy some Ethereum. For this step, you can purchase Ethereum in the Metamask wallet or on a crypto exchange.<\/p>\n<p>Option 1 \u2013 In the metamask mobile app you will want to press on the side panel and then \u201c Add Funds\u201d. The three integration options to buy ETH in the metamask wallet are: Wyre, Transak and Moonpay. After choosing one of them, they will take you through a step by step process in order to purchase some Ethereum. The ETH will arrive directly in your Metamask wallet.<\/p>\n<p>Option 2 \u2013 Purchasing Ethereum from an exchange. Gemini is one exchange we recommend. If you choose to purchase ETH from an exchange you will first need to sign up and create an account. Then you will need to enter your bank information so you are able to purchase ETH on the exchange. Once you have created a Gemini account, purchased Ethereum and created your MetaMask wallet, your last step is to send the ETH from your Gemini account to your MetaMask wallet. To copy your MetaMask wallet address- simply hover over \u201cAccount 1\u201d and the option \u201cCopy to clipboard\u201d will appear like in the below screenshot.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-489817 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Picture70.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"260\" height=\"436\"\/><\/p>\n<p>Once you send the Ethereum to your MetaMask wallet, the funds will appear and you will be able to purchase a Rad Rabbit NFT. To send the funds to your MetaMask wallet, click on the Transfer button in the top right corner of your Gemini profile- then select the \u201cWithdraw from Gemini\u201d page. Once you are at this page, you will select Ethereum as your currency to Withdraw and for the Destination you will want to copy your MetaMask deposit wallet address there. You will enter the amount and complete the withdraw.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3 \u2013 Purchasing the Rad Rabbit<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Once you have set up your wallet and you have Ethereum in your metamask you will want to navigate to the Rad Rabbits OpenSea page.
