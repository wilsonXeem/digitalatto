BTC started <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/bitcoin-resumes-decline-40k\/\">another decline<\/a> and traded below the $42,000 support level.<\/p>\n<p>The bears took control and pushed the price below the $41,000 level.

The price traded as low as $39,240 and is currently consolidating losses.<\/p>\n<p>An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $39,700 level. There is also a steep bearish trend line forming with resistance near $39,700 on the hourly chart of the BTC\/USD pair.<\/p>\n<p>The first major resistance is forming near the $40,000 level. The next resistance could be near $40,200. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $43,415 swing high from the $39,240 low. A clear move above the $40,000 and $40,200 levels might start a short-term recovery wave.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bitcoin-8.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-487921\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bitcoin-8.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin Price\" width=\"1834\" height=\"848\"  \/><\/a><\/p>\n<pre>Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/BTCUSD\/\">BTCUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p>In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise towards the $41,350 resistance zone. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $43,415 swing high from the $39,240 low.<\/p>\n<h2>More Losses in BTC?<\/h2>\n<p>If bitcoin fails to clear the $40,000 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. An immediate support on the downside is near the $39,250 level.<\/p>\n<p>The next major support is seen near the $38,880 level. A downside break below the $38,880 support zone could increase selling pressure.
