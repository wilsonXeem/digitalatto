The main breakout zone is now near the $3,000 level. A close above the $3,000 level could set the tone for a larger increase. In the stated case, ether price might rise towards the $3,150 resistance.<\/p>\n<h2>Dips Supported in ETH?<\/h2>\n<p>If ethereum fails to gain pace above the $2,980 resistance, it could start a downside correction. An initial support on the downside is near the $2,920 zone. The next major support is near the $2,900 level and the trend line.<\/p>\n<p>If there is a downside break below the trend line support, ether price might test the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $2,756 swing low to $2,969 high.
