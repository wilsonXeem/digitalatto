At the conclusion of his op-ed, he declared clearly that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Labor Department should not be able to limit the range or type of investments retirement savers can select.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Tuberville continued to say the following:<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cWhether or not you believe in the long-term economic prospects of cryptocurrency, the choice of what you invest your retirement savings in should be yours \u2014 not that of the government.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until now, no other senators have publicly expressed backing for the new bill which would surely be supported by the American people. To be referred to the House of Representatives for additional review, it would have to receive a majority of votes in the Senate. Democrats presently possess a majority in the Senate, making the passing of the law a difficult task.
