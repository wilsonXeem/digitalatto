The collection, which is dubbed \u2018SPACEBARS: PRELUDE,\u2019 will feature different collectible elements that\u2019ll unlock different areas of rewards for his fans. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>SPACEBARS: PRELUDE <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto.com\/nft\/\">drops<\/a> on April 13th and the <strong>NFTs will come in nine distinct 3D animated card variations<\/strong>, each with its own tier of rarity. There will be 900 Common, 90 Rare, and 9 Ultra Rare cards, which will each be distributed via \u2018Mystery Packs\u2019. Each pack will contain one card, meaning there are 999 packs up for grabs. Each will feature space exploration artwork which is inspired by that of Shay\u2019s 2020 EP \u2018365,\u2019 designed by Singaporean street artist EBAO, and its 3D aesthetic rendered by U.S. creative agency Wild Portals.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The accompanying track features an infusion of NFT and extraterrestrial wordplay, on top of an ethereal beat from UK producer superjdoug, a regular collaborator of Shay\u2019s. To link the melodic piece of art with the collection\u2019s digital artworks, the song and NFTs will be based on three different scenes from Shay\u2019s abstract astronaut journey, with each NFT unlocking four bars of the song.<\/p>\n<p>With this premise in mind, collectors of all three NFT scenes (regardless of rarity) will unlock the full song, which\u2019ll grant them access to redeem an \u2018Original Legendary\u2019 NFT featuring the 16-bar track in its entirety.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In addition, holders of Rare and Ultra Rare cards will be <strong>granted access to online listening sessions<\/strong> of unreleased music alongside Shay and his producers, whilst the 9 Ultra Rare holders will also receive a video shout out from the rapper.<\/p>\n<p>In commenting on the collection, the rapper had this to say: <i>\u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating for me is how NFTs and blockchain technology are going to change the music industry. I\u2019m so excited for the limitless possibilities that are going to happen with music in the NFT space\u201d.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>The rapper\u2019s foray into NFTs doesn\u2019t come as a surprise, as he has already proven himself to be an artist at the forefront of music technology, showcased through him being<strong> the first Southeast Asian artist to host a virtual concert<\/strong> where audiences were transported to a 360-degree environment, whilst he also performed as an avatar in mixed reality at the opening ceremony of the first-ever Global Esports Games.<\/p>\n<p><b>Follow ShiGGa Shay &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/ShiGGaShay\">Twitter<\/a>\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
