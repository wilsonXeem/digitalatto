To add an extra layer of authenticity and emotion to the short film, Bill Self, the two-time NCAA Champion head coach and former college coach of Embiid, serves as the film\u2019s narrator.<\/p>\n<p>The film uses <strong>Embiid\u2019s tough journey into NBA stardom<\/strong> to focus on commitment, determination, and overcoming adversity and doubt from others. In doing so, the production makes references towards Embiid\u2019s immigration to the USA from Cameroon at the age of 16, his recruitment by the renowned University of Kansas Jayhawks basketball team, and his experiences with injury and self-doubt during his collegiate and formative NBA years.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Of course, and as many will know, after overcoming all such hurdles, Embiid is now a five-times NBA All-Star, three-times member of the All-NBA Team and a three-time member of the All-Defensive Team. He also sits as the current <strong>NBA season\u2019s highest points scorer<\/strong>, which has led him to be recognised as a leading candidate for this year\u2019s Most Valuable Player (MVP) award.<\/p>\n<p>Embiid\u2019s \u2018Fortune Favors the Brave\u2019 edition comes in wake of the two other superstar editions featuring Matt Damon and LeBron James respectively, with the former serving as the film series\u2019 debut back in October 2021. Most recently, Crypto.com sponsored the 94th Academy Awards in the United States, in order to premiere its latest, humanitarian-related film which raised $3.6 million for Ukrainians via the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cryptocomnft\">Crypto.com\u2019s<\/a> inclusion of Embiid and LeBron in its marketing endeavours comes as part of the crypto exchange\u2019s relentless dedication to inserting its presence within high-level sporting contexts, as the company\u2019s logo can also be seen brandished across events such as the Miami Grand Prix, the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, the UFC, and a number of other global sports and entertainment properties.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Watch the film &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cryptocom\/status\/1522712826611183623\">Here<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
