This process includes standards, supervision, educational materials, and authorized uses. These are GAO\u2019s suggestions, although policymakers have the authority to retain the status quo. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">GAO intends to develop industry standards to address interoperability and data security issues. In addition, standards and consensus methods that are globally accepted should be implemented.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Diving into the GAO\u2019s report, it states an oversight strategy. Accordingly, this strategy may help resolve difficulties with legal and regulatory doubt and regulatory arbitrage. Also, GAO recommends additional educational materials. The main reason is to address issues of low comprehension and undetermined benefits and costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Furthermore, the fourth policy option is referred to as the suitable uses. In addition, it involves mitigating financial system risks and unspecified benefits and costs. The study points out that the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cftc.gov\/\">Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)<\/a> lacks the power to engage with non-governmental organizations. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In particular, the study notes that some prospective blockchain users may not profit from the technology because of legal or regulatory ambiguity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As of March 5, traditional banks in Virginia can now offer virtual currency custody services. This is possible after a bill amendment request has been approved by the Senate. Respectively, the bill was first proposed by Christopher T. Head, a member of the House of Delegates, in January 2022. Head made a statement regarding this issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">He said that a bank may provide <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a>\/digital currency custody services to its customers. But, to do so, the bank must have 26 good procedures in place to manage risks and follow the law. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The bill passed in the Senate. There was a resounding 39-0 majority in the Senate. Now the bill is in the hands of Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, who is expected to sign it into law.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\">\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/shibaswifecommunity\"><img src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" style=\"width:auto ;height:auto;\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/1648465560_826_ShibasWifeBannerGif3-1.gif\"\/><noscript><img src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/1648465560_826_ShibasWifeBannerGif3-1.gif\" style=\"width:auto ;height:auto;\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/noscript><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/us-congress-suggests-blockchain-policy\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Congress, federal agencies, state and local governments will benefit from GAO\u2019s blockchain deployment monitoring services.
