Even if the scenario happens, the company just might offer other collateral instead of crypto. Michael Saylor essentially implied that there is no price that would force MicroStrategy to give up on its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin (BTC) has plunged to its lowest level since July 2021 as a result of a price dip that has corresponded with a drop in the global financial markets, which has echoed through significant cryptocurrencies such as <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/ethereum-virtual-machine-explained\/\">Ethereum (ETH)<\/a> and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/solana-price-prediction-2022\/\">Solana (SOL).<\/a> The total <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization-explained\/\">market capitalization<\/a> of all cryptocurrencies is somewhat less than $1.5 trillion, down from a historical high in November.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experts are divided between the question if this is just another hit in the hard year that Bitcoin (BTC) has had, or a bear market descending upon cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) is on the edge of a significant support level, which analysts say might function as a test for the future price trajectory of Bitcoin (BTC), after dipping under $30,000 on May 10th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sharp drop in the cryptocurrency market, which saw Bitcoin (BTC) go below $30,000 for the first time since July 2021 Tuesday night,\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recent happenings in the crypto market such as the Bitcoin (BTC) price dip and the reduced market cap fuelled speculation that MicroStrategy would face a margin call, which was verified by Phong Le, the Outgoing CFO during the company\u2019s quarterly call last week, suggesting that a potential trigger could be a $21,000 level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having received a loan from Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) worth $205 million using Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral through the subsidiary of MicroStrategy, the company showed everyone during March that the Bitcoin (BTC) arsenal in their possession is quite valuable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saylor said that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cwe also furthered our position as the leading public company investor in bitcoin-backed term loans. We have demonstrated that our bitcoin can be productively used as collateral in capital raising transactions, which allows us to further execute our business strategy. Today, MicroStrategy is the world\u2019s largest publicly traded corporate owner of bitcoin with over 129,200 bitcoins.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the tweet and presentation slides of Michael Saylor appear to demonstrate that the firm now has plenty of pristine Bitcoin (BTC) available as additional collateral.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MicroStrategy\u2019s stock dropped almost 26% on Tuesday, mirroring the collapse in the price of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-is-bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin (BTC)<\/a>.
