In a new direct comparison between bear phases in Bitcoin since 2018, it could indicate that it is almost time for another bull season any day now.<\/p>\n<h2>Bull Market Cyclical Behavior<\/h2>\n<p>Months ago, the term \u201cfew\u201d was thrown around by the crypto community because not enough people understood the potential of what Bitcoin could do for them financially. Today, very few people are <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-mimics-market-sentiment\/\">expecting Bitcoin to rally<\/a> from here.<\/p>\n<p>Oftentimes, when the hive sentiment is at its most frothy, deep corrections set the masses straight. At the moment, Bitcoin bears are salivating for below $30,000, but they might not ever get it according to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/BTCUSD\/Li8o1VKD-Bitcoin-Bear-Season-End-Is-Near-Bull-Fractal-Time-Comparison\/\">a new comparison<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-mimics-market-sentiment\/\">Bitcoin Mimics Textbook Market Sentiment Cycle, What Happens When Confidence Returns?<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Any market exhibits <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-mimics-market-sentiment\/\">cyclical behavior<\/a> on multiple timeframes.

Each fractal measures at roughly 460 days. Alternating between each bear phase, is a short bullish impulse that shocks the world.<\/p>\n<p>Bull impulses last a mere 98 days, but tend to takes prices to unprecedented levels. At minimum, these bull phases have churned out more than 300% ROI. A 300% return from $40,000 would take the price per BTC <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/this-bitcoin-heatmap-suggests-a-blazing-cycle-peak-is-still-ahead\/\">to $120,000<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/this-bitcoin-heatmap-suggests-a-blazing-cycle-peak-is-still-ahead\/\">This Bitcoin \u201cHeatmap\u201d Suggests A Blazing Cycle Peak Is Still Ahead<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Each bear phase lasted just over 14 months.\u00a0Edwin \u201cSedge\u201d Coppock, creator of the technical indicator called <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Coppock_curve\">the Coppock curve<\/a>, found that the average time it takes for a human to get over mourning a loss was an average of 11 to 14 months.
