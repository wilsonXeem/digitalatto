What better then, than a hyper-realistic piece of high-fashion virtual armwear from luxury watch manufacturer, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DwissWatch\">DWISS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Heading to the NFT space in the near future, DWISS will launch 10k incredibly rendered <strong>NFT watches<\/strong>. Fine collectibles that will attain more and more utility as the project grows. As a result, the team will investigate methods of bringing DWISS wearables into <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/decentraland\">Decentraland<\/a> and <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheSandboxGame\">The Sandbox<\/a>, in addition to opening a virtual retail store in both worlds.<\/p>\n<p>Further down the line, DWISS will also integrate the non-fungible wristwatches into their bespoke AR application. All in addition to incorporating the dial designs as a smartwatch feature and enabling owners to show off their magnificent timepieces in both the virtual and everyday worlds.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>DWISS High-Fashion NFTs<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>At an as yet unconfirmed date, DWISS will launch a grand collection of 10k algorithmically generated non-fungible tokens, each with a fine array of designs and features of varying colour and scarcity. All ready to spark a little high fashion into the Web3 world, and its ecosystem of connected metaverses.<\/p>\n<p>Each watch will qualify its owner for entry into the <strong>DWISS collectors\u2019 community<\/strong> and provide exclusive access to events and experiences within the DWISS ecosystem. This will allow for participation into a DAO-based voting system, giving users a say in future designs, as well as qualifying for a 15% discount across the DWISS range of physical products.<\/p>\n<p>Following the initial launch, DWISS will take just 15% of income as profit while distributing a further 15% back into the community through various sustained efforts. Then, use the remaining 70% of mint proceeds to fuel further development, promotion, utility and artwork.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"M3W teaser\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fDXwIPS8JLY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h4><strong>$500k DWISS Physical Watch Giveaway<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>To celebrate its grand foray into the Web3 realm, DWISS will go all out with a fantastic $500k IRL watch giveaway.
