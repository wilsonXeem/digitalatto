This was an especially surprising price given that the asset had fallen to a monthly low of just $39,000 earlier this week.<\/p>\n<p>BTC, on the other hand, was roundly rejected at its local peak and quickly reversed course. The asset\u2019s value plummeted to $40,000 in a matter of hours.<\/p>\n<p>As the bulls lose the $40,000 support level, a level that has yet to be established as a meaningful line this year, the most valuable coin has no shortage of negative mid-term predictions.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin\u2019s price failed to retain the important levels of $41,500 and $40,000 despite a strong negative control. Bears are expected to aim for the $38,536 swing low from Monday, which is a clear objective for those still in the trade. If the swing low is breached, the BTC price may be disappointed and fall back to low $36,000.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization has dropped to $750 billion, after briefly surpassing $800 billion earlier this week.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/btc\/why-a-boring-bitcoin-could-be-a-good-thing\/\">Why A \u201cBoring\u201d Bitcoin Could Be A Good Thing<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Buy Or Sell?<\/h2>\n<p>BTC price has to open above $44,088.73 on Monday, as a Macron victory will cause the Greenback to fall further, allowing for further upside possibilities. Add to that the fact that news from Ukraine is becoming increasingly second-tier and receding into the background, indicating that talks are still ongoing and a solution might be reached at any time, as Russian military efforts are now focused solely on the west, rather than the entirety of Ukraine.<\/p>\n<p>The French election is the major event risk this weekend. If Le Pen, a far-right candidate, defeats Macron in the election, expect a huge market shift and shock on Sunday evening and Monday in the ASIA PAC session.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, investors are \u2018waiting and watching\u2019 to see how the supply-demand situation will react to the support area. Since late January, the BTC price has been trading in a \u2018rising wedge pattern,\u2019 as shown on the weekly chart.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-488767 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/btc9.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin\" width=\"1510\" height=\"821\"  \/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC\/USD trades at $39k.
