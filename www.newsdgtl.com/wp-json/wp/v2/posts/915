With the bulls strengthening with each passing day, the meme-coin has continued to secure more and more buyers. The Relative Strength Index which is indicative of buying strength was parked above the 80-mark. This reading symbolizes overvalued tendencies.<\/p>\n<p>Correspondingly, the price of the coin was seen trading above the 20-SMA line which signified a bullish stance. This meant that the buyers in the market were responsible for driving the price momentum at the moment.<\/p>\n<p>Dogecoin could continue to move in a northbound direction further, given the cup and handle pattern (indicated in white) that the coin has formed on its charts.
