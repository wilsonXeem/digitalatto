The council\u2019s letter focuses, in part, on comparing Bitcoin mines to computer data centers.\u00a0 They aim to highlight that the EPA has no jurisdiction to dictate what happens inside a data center.<\/p>\n<h2>Letters to the EPA<\/h2>\n<p>The congress members had asked the EPA to evaluate the \u201ccompliance with environmental statutes\u201d of proof of work mining.\u00a0 The group claimed,<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe have serious concerns regarding reports that cryptocurrency facilities across the country are polluting communities and are having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. As cryptocurrency gains popularity, it is essential to understand the environmental risks and pollution associated with this industry,\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The Bitcoin Mining Council replied directly to the statement above, stating;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe statement above unfortunately confuses datacenters with power generation facilities. Power generation facilities are not datacenters. Datacenters which contain \u201cminers\u201d are no different than datacenters owned and operated by Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Miners vs power plants<\/h2>\n<p>The group\u2019s logic attempts to separate the relationship between the mining hardware and the power used to operate them. Bitcoin ASIC miners are specialized computers designed to do one task exceptionally efficiently. A server at Amazon, Google, or Microsoft is also a computer designed to do a job to the highest standard. In their letter, the mining council stated no difference between the two. The EPA does not get involved with the nature of cloud computing servers and their software operations, so why would they evaluate the functions of a Bitcoin ASIC miner?<\/p>\n<p>Further, the council highlighted that Bitcoin miners do not emit harmful emissions.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cDatacenters engaged in the industrial-scale mining of digital assets do not emit CO2 or any other pollutants.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Renewable energy and EPA oversight<\/h2>\n<p>The council also cited the recent Bitcoin Mining Council <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/bitcoin-mining-council-thinks-tesla-may-accept-btc-again-for-this-reason\/\">report<\/a> that indicated the use of renewable has risen to 58.4%. The eight-page response to the original request clarifies that there is a difference between energy generation and energy use. Should the EPA evaluate the use of energy? Currently, the EPA categorizes traditional mining regulations into air, asbestos, water, and waste. The overall energy usage does not come into question. Thus, it could be argued that if Bitcoin mining requires EPA oversight, then Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and gold miners should also be subject to further assessment.<\/p>\n<div class=\"edge-cta hidden\">\n<h2>Get an <span>Edge<\/span> on the Crypto Market \ud83d\udc47<\/h2>\n<p>Become a member of CryptoSlate Edge and access our exclusive Discord community, more exclusive content and analysis.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cols\">\n<p> <span class=\"img chart\"\/> <strong>On-chain analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> <span class=\"img price\"\/> <strong>Price snapshots<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> <span class=\"img context\"\/> <strong>More context<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.memberful.com\/checkout?plan=43765\" class=\"btn join\">Join now for $19\/month<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/edge\/\" class=\"btn\">Explore all benefits<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/is-a-bitcoin-miner-the-same-as-an-amazon-server-and-why-does-it-matter\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Bitcoin Mining\u00a0 Council, led by Michael Saylor, has hit back at a US Congress group that petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency to criticize proof of work mining.
