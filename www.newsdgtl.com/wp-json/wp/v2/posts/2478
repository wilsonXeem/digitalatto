The uncertainty around the war between Ukraine and Russia, and the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) hike in interest rates seem to be the two main catalysts for the weakness in the global market.<\/p>\n<p>Legendary trader Peter Brandt seems to favor the short-term bearish thesis. Pseudonym users shared a Bitcoin price prediction with Brandt which suggest the cryptocurrency could revisit critical areas of support below $30,000.<\/p>\n<p>This could BTC\u2019s price to $28,000 or $27,000 as soon as May or June this year. This prediction matches that of BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes. He expects BTC and ETH to crash to $30,000 and $2,000, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>As seen below, in the chart presented to Brandt, Bitcoin would drop to its support zone before resuming its bullish momentum into uncharted territory. In the months after that, the first crypto by market cap could rise by about $100,000.
