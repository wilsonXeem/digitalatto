After exploring the nature of the digital asset, the judge ruled that NFTs were \u2018property,\u2019 and thus able to have access to legal protections.<\/p>\n<p>In this instance, the protection on offer was an injunction served onto Ozone Networks (which hosts OpenSea) to freeze the assets, as well as a Bankers Trust disclosure which compelled OpenSea to release information about the two account holders who <strong>hold the stolen NFTs<\/strong>. In addition, a permission to serve the orders regardless of jurisdiction was issued, which is significant considering the largely unbeknownst whereabouts of Web3 actors and activity.<\/p>\n<p>In speaking on the case, Racheal Muldoon, a counsel on the case, said: <i>\u201cIt is of the utmost significance as, for the first time in the world (as far as we are aware), a court of law has recognized\u00a0that an NFT is property capable of being frozen by way of an injunction. This ruling, therefore, removes any uncertainty that NFTs (as tokens consisting of code) are property in and of themselves, distinct from the thing they represent (e.g., a digital artwork),\u00a0under the law of England and Wales\u201d.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Now such ruling has taken place, the next stages of <strong>Osbourne\u2019s NFT retrieval<\/strong> have taken place, which include OpenSea\u2019s blocking of the NFT sales on its platform, as well as the hiring of intelligence firm Mitmark to collate evidence, identify the current holders, and facilitate the assets\u2019 return.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
