Although there was a period where it had tapered off, it had continued to rise once more. The culmination of this has been a massive inflow into various centralized exchanges, presumably for investors to sell off their coins. Now the inflows have hit a new three-month high, painting a rather grim picture for the future of the digital asset.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Inflows Take Over<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Bitcoin investors have been dumping their holdings since the digital asset started its descent from its $69,000 all-time high. Although outflows had rivaled inflows, the rate at which BTC was flowing into exchanges remained a cause for alarm.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In a chart posted by Glasnode Alerts, it shows how inflows have been moving in relation to price. Following the historical pattern of inflows increasing when the price is down, the market had seen more and more bitcoins moved onto exchanges for sale.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Related Reading |\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/ape\/ape-takes-a-beating\/\">APE Takes A Beating As It Sheds 50% Of Its Price<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The exchange inflow volume on a 7-day moving average touched a three-month high of 1,729.605 BTC flowing into exchanges.

This is no surprise given the low sentiment that has plagued the market in recent times. Going by the charts, if this does descend into another full-blown bear market, then investors could be dealing with low prices for another year.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Naturally, whales who have a large stake in the market are trying to exit in order to avoid more losses. This is backed by the bitcoin\u2019s relative unrealized profit hitting a new 18-month low of 0.462. This means that investors are taking a profit.
