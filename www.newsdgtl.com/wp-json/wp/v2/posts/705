Players\u2019 ownership over Delysium\u2019s game assets (tokens, NFTs, game resources, etc.) will be fully decentralized and interoperable among various compatible blockchains quickly, reducing the cost of play and revenue acquisition for users.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Delysium and Polygon Studios \u2014 the NFT and gaming arm of Polygon \u2014 will work together on technical solutions, game distribution, asset expansion, industry resources, branding, and other aspects to promote the rapid development and launch of Delysium.<\/p>\n<p>Billing itself as a cyberpunk style, open-world, MMORPG, Delysium allows players to earn loot boxes by joining various game modes, including PVE and PVP. Players can then sell earned items in the Delysium marketplace, use them to upgrade their character and equipment, or craft user-generated content (UGC).<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/c92b422a59eca27b65aa157997f561c26edfbc2d.png\" data-cke-saved-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/c92b422a59eca27b65aa157997f561c26edfbc2d.png\"\/><\/p>\n<p>In addition to its play-and-earn mechanism, Delysium also features a bedrock of in-game NPCs powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Notably, these AI-driven NPCs can be purchased or rented by the player and set to work to complete tasks and earn passive income for the user character.<\/p>\n<p>Known as \u2018MetaBeings,\u2019 these AI-powered NPCs can be used by the player to carry out automated yield farming within the game and perform all the tasks that the player would normally do by themselves. MetaBeings are algorithmically designed to learn the most effective player behaviors over time.<\/p>\n<p>They will involve in the production, acquisition, utilization, and consumption of data in the virtual world, generating more diverse digital content and experiences. MetaBeings can be upgraded by the player as the game progresses until they are virtually indistinguishable from actual human users.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/c496e537cec39a6f7f935581f4fbe6df681554e3.png\" data-cke-saved-src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/c496e537cec39a6f7f935581f4fbe6df681554e3.png\"\/><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u201cDelysium presents a unique user experience that exemplifies what can be achieved via the blockchain.
