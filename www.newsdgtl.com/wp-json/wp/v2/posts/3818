As you would expect, projects which fall under this category can predominantly be described as being in the \u2018Blue Chip\u2019 variety, whether that be a Punk, Ape, or Doodle.

In doing so, those leveraging their Pawn Bot NFTs can enjoy HiFi\u2019s fixed-rate, fixed-term lending protocol.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone holding Mainframe ($MFT), the token of HiFi Finance, can mint a Pawn Bot (at a TBD date), which they can then liquidate back into $MFT through the project\u2019s buyback guarantee (as freely as they wish). This distinguishing combination of <strong>flexibility and utility<\/strong> makes Pawn Bots one of the very few \u2018low-risk investments in high-risk times\u2019 that doesn\u2019t require a mammoth load of capital in order to acquire.<\/p>\n<p>This philosophy follows that of the CryptoPunks in two ways, with the first being that investors were initially able to mint a Punk for free amid the bear market of 2018 to 2020 (with only $6 gas fees to pay), and the second being that Punks have gone on to be formidable, uncorrelated assets which are able to maintain financial value amid any level of market turmoil.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Pawn Bots\u2019 Cinematography Foray\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>To represent its understanding of what the NFT community values in not only asset utility, but in projects as a whole, Pawn Bots has premiered its first <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PawnBots\/status\/1524837183974039552\">3D animated NFT video<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Where do NFTs go during a bear market?<br \/>\u201cThe Talk\u201d NFT video premiere. \ud83c\udfac \ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f\ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f\ud83c\udf79 <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/1bYtU5Gq9J\">pic.twitter.com\/1bYtU5Gq9J<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Pawn Bots (@PawnBots) <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PawnBots\/status\/1524837183974039552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 12, 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Through a convocation between a \u2018derivative\u2019 Doodle x Ape son, and his ape father, as they lay sipping on cocktails which have been served up by a Pawn Bot, the video creatively manifests the<strong> primordial dilemma<\/strong> of the \u2018birds and the bees talk\u2019 into the context of NFTs, a premise every NFT enthusiast will enjoy. Cameos from Mutant Apes and a Moonbird are also observed, as well as a comedic reference to one of the biggest pop-culture stories of 2022 (see if you can spot it).<\/p>\n<p>Despite its comedic purpose, and with the inclusion of unquestionably uncorrelated NFTs, the video is designed with the purpose of portraying the ambition of the Pawn Bots project, and further, its desire for the community to enjoy blockchain-related wealth that isn\u2019t comprised by fluctuating market conditions.<\/p>\n<p><b>Visit Pawn Bots &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pawnbots.com\/\">Website<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
