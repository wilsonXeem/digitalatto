This suggested that capital was flowing toward Bitcoin (BTC) as opposed to other altcoins in the market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Furthermore, Tether (USDT) has plummeted from 4.87% in the week before to 4.28% at the time of writing, indicating that market players were starting to invest in cryptocurrencies after sitting on the sidelines with Tether (USDT). According to a recent analysis on the biggest <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/11-best-cryptocurrency-news-websites-in-the-world\/\">cryptocurrency<\/a>, a phase of increased volatility is on the horizon for <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bitcoin-bonds-in-el-salvador-postponed\/\">Bitcoin (BTC)<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When the $59.1k level was breached and challenged as resistance, the decline of Bitcoin (BTC) commenced, and it seemed to endure until early February. Bitcoin (BTC), on the other hand, soared to a new high of $45.8k at the beginning of February.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Importantly, this level was greater than the Bitcoin (BTC) downward trend\u2019s latest lower high, which was $44.6k. Simultaneously, the price dropped to new lows, which in turn signified that the decline had at the very minimum come to a halt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The $45.8k level shows a strong supply position, and sellers are predicted to be dominant up to $52k. As a result, while a lengthier negative bias has decreased significantly, the bulls were also not in control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For Bitcoin (BTC), the signs revealed a similar scenario. Following almost a month of struggling, the RSI had risen over the neutral 50 levels. In addition, the MACD created a bullish confluence and rose over zero. Each of these indicators suggested that the bulls&#8217; stronghold on the market had diminished, and that <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/bearish-bullish-meaning-in-cryptocurrency\/\">bullish<\/a> momentum was not as significant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The OBV went even deeper, emphasizing how, notwithstanding a disruption in market structure, the demand of buyers was merely insufficient. Since November, the OBV has been on a steady decline, however, it has risen slightly since January 2022. This move, however, was unlikely to prompt a new upward rise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Buyers and sellers competed intensely through every important horizontal level as the Bitcoin (BTC) price seemed to be recovering. The $44k-$45k range was a significant <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/resistance-level-definition\/\">resistance<\/a> zone, with $48k also acting as a barrier. The $38k level, as well as the $35k-$36.4k range, could provide assistance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-will-the-future-bring-for-btc-trading-in-this-consolidation-period\/\">What Will the Future Bring for BTC Trading in this Consolidation Period?<\/a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\">Crypto Academy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto-academy.org\/what-will-the-future-bring-for-btc-trading-in-this-consolidation-period\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bitcoin (BTC) had reached a low of 39.5% back in January and has been gradually growing since then.
