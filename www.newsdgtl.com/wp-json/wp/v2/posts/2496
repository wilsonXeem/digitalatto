With that big dip, investors and traders are increasingly aware of the risks and have decided to wait on the sidelines and see what happens next rather than risk severe losses along the way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, not taking action at the right time can hurt and decrease market returns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Altcoins also went further down compared to Bitcoin. Fundamentally, it is typical for altcoins to underperform when pitted with other cryptocurrencies especially BTC because it has a higher risk profile in comparison to BTC.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Despite Dip, Bitcoin Remains Stable<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On a more positive note, technical indicators have shown that Bitcoin is meant to be more stable at $38,500 even with the reduced price momentum. Traders are always on the lookout for unexpected spikes in prices so the downtrend with BTC may make it entirely painstaking for options traders to generate profit in these erratic price swings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/ARqH6Vdf\/\" width=\"1834\" height=\"875\"\/><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">BTC total market cap at $755. billion on the weekend chart | Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p class=\"jeg_post_title\" style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Suggested Reading | <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/shib\/is-shiba-inu-the-next-crypto-gold\/\">Move Over Bitcoin \u2013 Is Shiba Inu The Next Crypto Gold?<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Current trends circling the crypto and metaverse worlds can greatly impact how traders behave. For instance, when BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said that there is an impending BTC price crash looking at around $30,000, there followed traders selling their BTC. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This caused traders to sell their May and June option calls like crazy causing the risk reversals to drop from -6% to about -10%\u00a0 for both Bitcoin and Ethereum.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Still A Bullish Trend<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With Bitcoin\u2019s lowest low registering the past couple of days, this also highlights the minimized bearish sentiment on the side of options traders. Traders being cautious at this point in time are fairly predictable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Overall, the global cryptocurrency market trading activities have been significantly reduced at $1.88 with very minimal gains seen in the last 24 hours. Even so, the total trading volume rose to around 18%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While the very strict monetary policy has negatively impacted speculative assets like cryptocurrencies and stocks, the indicators clearly show that it will stay bullish for a little while.<\/span><\/p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center\">Featured image from EPA-EFE, chart from <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/ajrdy9Lf\/\">TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-struggles-to-breach-40000\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bitcoin isn\u2019t the king of cryptocurrency for nothing.
