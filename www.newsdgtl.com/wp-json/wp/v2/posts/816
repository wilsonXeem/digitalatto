However, in their opinion, it already looked \u201cas if ADA is replicating Ethereum\u2019s (<span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COINBASE:ETHUSD\">ETHUSD<\/span>)\u00a0<span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bullish<\/span> break-out in early January 2017.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cSee how the price action that led to this since March 2016 is also quite similar to ADA\u2019s price action since May 2021.
