ETH broke the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/ada\/ethereum-breaks-key-support\/\">$3,000 resistance zone<\/a> to move into a short-term positive zone.<\/p>\n<p>There was a move above the $3,020 resistance level. Ether was able to clear the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $3,310 swing high to $2,951 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $3,035 on the hourly chart of ETH\/USD.<\/p>\n<p>The price is now trading above the $3,050 level. On the upside, an initial resistance is seen near the $3,085 level. The next major resistance is near the $3,130 level and the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/eth\/ethereum-takes-hit-3k\/\">100 hourly simple moving average<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The 50% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $3,310 swing high to $2,951 low is also near the $3,130 level. A close above the $3,130 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average might start a decent recovery wave.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Ethereum-8.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-488018\" src=\"https:\/\/www.newsdgtl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Ethereum-8.png\" alt=\"Ethereum Price\" width=\"1834\" height=\"848\"  \/><\/a><\/p>\n<pre>Source: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/ETHUSD\/\">ETHUSD on TradingView.com<\/a><\/pre>\n<p>The next major resistance could be near the $3,170. A clear move above the $3,170 resistance could set the pace for a move above the $3,200 level. In the stated case, the price could climb above the $3,250 zone.<\/p>\n<h2>Fresh Decline in ETH?<\/h2>\n<p>If ethereum fails to start a recovery wave above the $3,130 level, it could start a fresh decline. An initial support on the downside is near the $3,020 zone.<\/p>\n<p>The next major support is near the $2,950 level. If there is a downside break below the $2,950 support, the price could start another decline.
