Murray is also said to embed some of the NFTs with his version of stories which were shared in the 2018 documentary, \u2018The Bill Murray Stories: Life Lessons Learned from a Mythical Man,\u2019 which he didn\u2019t actually partake in.<\/p>\n<p>Collectively, the collection will provide Murray fans with an extremely eclectic, personal and novel medium of owning memoirs of the legendary comedy figure.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want more?
