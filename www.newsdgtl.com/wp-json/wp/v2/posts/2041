We don't want to comment on next steps until that path is at least visible to us.\"\/><\/p>\n<p>Crypto hack mitigators Lossless have reached out and Beanstalk will likely need strong partners to recover from this. Commentors on Beanstalk\u2019s Twitter account have speculated that it was an \u2018inside job\u2019 conducted by Beanstalk to leave retail as exit liquidity. However, until more details come to light, it\u2019s all speculation.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We\u2019re engaging all efforts to try to move forward.
