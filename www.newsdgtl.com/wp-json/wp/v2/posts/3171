To ensure that the funds raised in the sale stay within a circulation which continues to empower female content creators, pplpleasr has opted for all proceeds to be donated to the Annenberg Accelerator Program, which is an initiative set up by the University of Southern California.<\/p>\n<p>The 75 animated Producer Pass NFTs are built on the Ethereum blockchain, and are available to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.shibuya.xyz\/cannes-brut\">mint<\/a> via <strong>pplpleasr\u2019s own NFT platform Shibuyu<\/strong>.
