The game takes place in the distant 2088 in a dystopian megapolis. Players can collect their unique scarce NFTs and fight fo resources to dominate the cityblocks. Their task is to get as many resources and lands as possible, which are necessary for the survival and progress. Some resources can be bought from other participants or created on your own, and some will have to be fought for in battles. The game is divided into two main parts of the gameplay: Cyber City map and Battles.<\/p>\n<h4>CyberCity Map<\/h4>\n<p>In fact, the Cybercity Inc map is the place where the events of the game unfold. Users can buy certain blocks of land and create their own sectors and buildings on them, as well as extract the necessary resources. There are 4 resource types: GOTA, MePa, BMass, and WJuice. Each resource can be earned or conquered in battles.<\/p>\n<p>When they are no longer enough, the player can decide to buy new lands with the help of NFT or try to win them back from opponents. In the future, users will be able to rent part of the land and receive rental payments in CYBR tokens. The better a piece of land is fortified and developed, the higher its value.<\/p>\n<h4>CyberCity fights<\/h4>\n<p>As mentioned above, the fight for resources can be not only economic but also physical. In fact, players can reclaim land and resources from their opponents using advanced warriors. Each character(Cyberian) has their own superpower and abilities, as well as weapons: from samurai blades to magic spells. Players can use the abilities of warriors, as well as upgrade them, increasing their strength and vitality.<\/p>\n<p>Each warrior has his own companion who helps in battles, gives buffs, or heals the owner in case of injury.<\/p>\n<h3>Game characters and clans<\/h3>\n<p>In total, the game provides 10 clans and 10 types of heroes and companions who have different skills and strengths.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the main heroes of <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cybercity.game\">CyberCity<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Cyber Samurai and Armored Shiba Inu.

Because of their rebellious nature, they can only be tamed by someone truly terrifying.<\/p>\n<p>Street Fighter and Stray Cat. A man with armed hands whos accompanied by a Stray Cat. Unlike his ancestors, he\u2019s way bigger than the ordinary cat with intellect and ferocity.<\/p>\n<p>Mercenaries and Iapetus.

Paladins is supported by MechAngel, which is an attempt to recreate the characters from the long perished religious texts.<\/p>\n<p>Scavengers and Multipurpose Drone Companion. Scavengers prowl the streets for spoils. Their companions, Multipurpose Drones, help to forget about the monolith solitude of modern existence. It is full of surprises since even its creators sometimes don\u2019t know what it\u2019s built from.<\/p>\n<p>To get a character, weapons, and companions, you need to purchase one of the three boxes. Each box contains one or more characters and weapons, companions, and a piece of land.<\/p>\n<h3>NFT marketplace<\/h3>\n<p>CyberCity NFT marketplace is live. Now players can buy, sell and trade valuable NFT assets.

Firstly, users can profit from owning virtual lands in the Cyber.City virtual city. To do this, it is enough to buy a certain piece of land. If the user upgrades his piece of land, that is, he builds some kind of building or increases its scale, then its cost increases, and therefore the income of the owner also grows. Secondly, the user can sell his site at any time and profit from the sale.<\/p>\n<p>Active income directly depends on the professionalism and level of the player. You can receive CYBR tokens from:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sale of resources inside the game for CYBR, namely the sale of in-game resources to other players for the CYBR token inside the game by mutual agreement between the players<\/li>\n<li>Selling NFTs for CYBR on the marketplace to other players<\/li>\n<li>Attacking the cells of other players in order to steal CYBR tokens. The player can form a detachment and send it to the enemy cell, if the strength of the attacking team of the player is greater, then he captures part of the CYBR tokens, if less, then he only spends energy.<\/li>\n<li>Battles with other players where the player can win back resources and CYBR currency in case of victory<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The CYBR token is used as a means of payment within the game. It is an in-game token that is used as an internal means of payment. In addition, users receive rewards for completing stages and completing missions in the CYBR token. Other types of earnings will also be available for players, such as farming and staking.<\/p>\n<p>Already in April, the developer company will hold a public CYBR token sale(IDO), where everyone can purchase crypto coins to buy NFTs and upgrade their heroes. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cybercity.game\">Details here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>CyberCity presents a unique Play2Earn game with great gameplay &amp; NFT characters with two types of earnings: active and passive, thanks to which any user can earn income from participating in the game, even if he is not an active gamer.
